<p style="text-align: center; font-variant: small-caps">With a Preface by<br />
General Bramwell Booth</p>

<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>Colonel Duff has, at my request, written the following
very interesting
and touching account of my dear Mother; and she has
done so in the hope
that those who read it will be helped to follow in
the footsteps of that
wonderful servant of God.</p>

<p>But how can they do so? Was not Mrs. Booth, you ask,
an exceptional
woman? Had she not great gifts and very remarkable
powers, and was she
not trained in a very special way to do the work to
which God called her?
How, then, can ordinary people follow in her steps?
Let me tell you.</p>

<p>Mrs. Booth walked with God. When she was only a timid
girl, helping her
mother in the household, she continually sought after
Him; and when, in
later years, she became known by multitudes, and was
written of in the
newspapers, and greatly beloved by the good in many
lands, there was no
difference in her life in that matter. She was not
content with being
Mrs. General Booth of The Salvation Army, and with
being looked upon as a
great and good woman, giving her life to bless others.
No!  she listened
daily for God&#8217;s voice in her own heart, sought
after His will, and leaned
continually for strength and grace upon her Saviour.
 You can be like her
in that.</p>

<p>Mrs. Booth was a soul-winner. A little while before
her spirit passed
into the presence of God, and when she knew that death
was quite near to
her, she said: &#8217;Tell the Soldiers that the great
consolation for a
Salvationist on his dying bed is to feel that he has
been a soul-winner.&#8217;<br />
Wherever she went&ndash;in the houses of strangers as well
as of friends, in
the Meetings, great and small, when she was welcomed
and when she was
not, whether alone or with others&ndash;she laboured to
lead souls to Christ.
I have known her at one time spend as much trouble
to win one as at
another time to win fifty. You can follow her example
in that.</p>

<p>Mrs. Booth always declared herself and took sides
with right.  Whatever
was happening around her, people always knew which
side she was on. She
spoke out for the right, the good, and the true, even
when doing so
involved very disagreeable experiences and the bearing
of much
unkindness.  She hated the spirit which can look on
at what is wicked and
false or cruel, and say, &#8216;Oh, that is not my
affair!&#8217; You can follow her<br />
example in this also.</p>

<p>Mrs. Booth laboured all her life to improve her gifts.
She thought; she
prayed; she worked; she read&ndash;above all, she read
her Bible.  It was her
companion as a child, as a young follower of Christ,
and then as a Leader
in The Army. Those miserable words which some of us
hear so often about
some bad or unfinished work&ndash;&#8217;Oh, that will
do&#8217;&ndash;were seldom heard from
her lips.  She was always striving, striving, striving
to do better, and
yet better, and again better still. All this also
you can do.</p>

<p>Mrs. Booth was full of sympathy. No one who was in
need or in sorrow, or
who was suffering, could meet her without finding
out that,  she was in
sympathy with them.  Her heart was tender with the
love of Christ, and so
she was deeply touched by the sin and sorrow around
her just as He was.
Even the miseries of the dumb animals moved her to
efforts on their
behalf. This sympathy made Mrs. Booth quick to see
and appreciate the
toil and self-denial of others, and ever grateful
for any kindness shown
to her or to The Army or to those in need of any kind.
The very humblest
and youngest of those who read this little book can
be like her in all this.</p>

<p>Mrs. Booth endured to the end. She never turned back.
She was faithful.
Her life and work would have been spoilt if she had
given up the fight.
She was often sorely tempted. She was slandered and
misrepresented by
enemies, betrayed by false friends, and often deeply
wounded by those who
professed to love her, though they deserted the Flag.
But she held fast.
You can be like her in that.  You may make many mistakes,
suffer many
defeats, but you can still keep going on, and it is
to those who go on to
the very end, whether in weakness or in strength,
that Jesus will give
the crown of life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Booth trusted with all her heart in the love
and sacrifice of her
Saviour. These were her hope and her strength. When
at the height of her
influence and popularity she delighted in that wonderful
song which we<br />
still so often sing:&ndash;</p>

<blockquote>I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me,<br />
And purchased my pardon when nailed to the tree;</blockquote>

<p>and when, amid much suffering, she lay dying, we often
sang together with her:&ndash;</p>

<blockquote>Victory for me!<br />
Through the Blood of Christ my Saviour;<br />
Victory for me!<br />
Through the precious Blood.</blockquote>

<p>This was her victory. You can follow her in the faith
that won it. Will you?</p>

<h2>Childhood</h2>

<p>&#8217;Parents who love God best will not allow their
children to learn anything which could not be pressed
into His service.&#8217;&ndash;<i>Mrs</i>. <i>Booth</i>.</p>

<p>The Mother of The Salvation Army was born at Ashbourne,
in Derbyshire, on January 17, 1829, and God gave to
her the very best gift He can give to any child&ndash;a
good and holy mother.</p>

<p>Katie Mumford, as she was then called, had no sister
to play with, and of her four brothers only one lived
to be a man. But her dear mother more than made up
for every lack, and from her lips the little girl learned
those blessed lessons which, in her turn, she has taught
to us.</p>

<p>One lesson which Mrs. Mumford early taught her daughter
was that our bodies will not live for ever. She took
Katie to see the body of her infant brother who had
just died; and, though she was not more than two years
old at the time, Katie never forgot that first lesson.
Spiritual things were even then real to her, just
because they were so real to her mother. Heaven was
home to her, and Jesus her best Friend, ever near to
help and guide her.</p>

<p>Truthfulness was a second of those early lessons which
remained with our Army Mother all her life. She was
but four years old when Mrs. Mumford found her one
evening sobbing bitterly in her little cot long after
she should have been asleep. She had told a falsehood,
and conscience would not let her rest. When she had
sobbed out her confession, her mother talked and prayed
with her, and at last left her, happy in the assurance
that she was forgiven by her Heavenly Father.</p>

<p>After this you will not be surprised to hear that
another lesson early taught to Katie by her mother
was to love her Bible. She could read nicely when
she was but five years old, and she loved to stand
by her mother&#8217;s side, and read the Bible stories
aloud, with just a little help over the very long
words. And this love for God&#8217;s Word grew deeper
every year, so that by the time she was twelve years
old she had read it through eight times. In later
years people often wondered how it was that Mrs. Booth
knew her Bible so well, and could so quickly answer
their difficulties and objections in Bible words.
Much of the secret lay in this early training, and
in the hours she spent in Bible study later on, when
she had reached the age of some of our younger Corps
Cadets.</p>

<p>I wish we could have seen her in those days. She had
very dark hair, which curled naturally; black, flashing
eyes, and such a warm heart, and strong, impetuous
nature that she could do nothing by halves. Whatever
it was, work or play, her whole soul had to be in
it.</p>

<p>Since she was not at all strong, and had few girl
friends, Katie did not play rough or noisy games,
but her love for her dolls made her quite a little
mother to them. She treated them almost like real children,
and would sew and toil, and never rest till she felt
she had in every way done her duty to them. She loved
animals, too, especially dogs and horses, and could
not bear to see any one ill-treat them. Oh, how she
suffered one day, watching some poor sheep driven down
the road! She watched the man beat them&ndash;she could
not stop him; and at last she tore home, and flung
herself down almost choking and speechless with indignation
and distress.</p>

<p>Her mother did not check Katie for feeling so keenly.
She encouraged her; for she knew that a hard, indifferent
child, who can see suffering and not care or be distressed
over it, would make a hard woman; and she wanted her
Katie to be full of love and tenderness for all, and
especially for those needing help.</p>

<p>When Catherine was twelve years old she became very
interested in the drink question. She wrote letters
about it, and sent them to different newspapers, for
there was no &#8216;War Cry&#8217; nor &#8216;Young
Soldier&#8217; in those days; and she also became
the secretary of what was then called a Juvenile Temperance
Society, and did all she could to get boys and girls
to promise never to touch the drink.</p>

<p>Katie was also, like many of you, much interested
in the heathen. She would go round to all her friends
collecting money to pay for preachers to be sent to
them; and in order to get more money she would deny
herself sugar and other small luxuries. No one told
Katie to do this; but you see our Army Mother herself
taught us, by her example when only a child, to keep
our great Self-Denial Week.</p>

<p>Of course, most of Katie&#8217;s time was taken up
with her lessons, and, as she loved to learn and study,
they were no hardship to her. For two years she went
to a boarding-school, and here her companions soon
found out how straight and truthful she was. &#8217;You&#8217;ll
never get <i>her</i> to tell a lie,&#8217; the
girls said, &#8216;nor even to exaggerate, so it&#8217;s
no use trying.&#8217; Every one knew also that Katie
felt for the backward girls and those who were slow
and dull. She wanted them to succeed, and would help
them between school hours. That was her joy, you see&ndash;to
help and care for others; whether at school or at
home she was the same.</p>

<p>But you must not think that Catherine was perfect.
Oh, no, indeed! Sometimes her schoolmates would tease
her because she was so quiet, and liked to read better
than to play; and at such times, instead of being
patient, she would flare up into a passion, and say
harsh, angry words. When the storm was over she would
be, however, Oh! so sorry, and would beg her schoolfellows
to forgive her.</p>

<p>When Katie had been at school two years, God sent
her a very great trial. Instead of being able to go
on learning and keeping up with the other girls, she
had to return home, and for three long years to lie
nearly all the time on her back, often suffering very
much. She had a serious spinal complaint, and her
friends sometimes doubted whether she would ever walk
again.</p>

<p>You wonder what she did in those three years? I will
tell you. When the pain would permit it, she would
knit and sew. She could not, of course, hold heavy
needlework; but little things, like babies&#8217; socks
and hoods, pin-cushions, and so forth, she would make
most beautifully, and then they would be sold to help
on the work of God.</p>

<p>Besides her sewing, Katie read a great deal. First,
as I have already told you, she read her Bible, and
learnt to know God&#8217;s thoughts about the world
and sin, and His wishes for His people. For seven months
at one time Catherine had to lie on her face on a
special sort of couch made on purpose for her; but
she invented a contrivance by which, even then, she
could read her Bible, though still remaining in the
position that the doctors wished. Then, too, she would
read good books&ndash;explanations of the Bible, about
Holiness, soul-saving, lives of those who have lived
and worked for God, and so on. When she had read a
chapter she would shut the book, and write down as
much as she could remember of it. This helped her
to think clearly and to remember what she read, and
also to put her thoughts into words.</p>

<p>But she never wasted her time reading stories and
novels. Later on in her life she said she was so thankful
for this, for she thought that novels and silly story
books made people discontented with their own homes
and duties, and put wrong, hurtful ideas into their
minds. Let us recollect and follow our Army Mother&#8217;s
example here, and not waste time on stories which
are not true.</p>

<p>We, if we had known Katie Mumford in those three years
of pain and weariness, should have pitied her very
much. We might have been tempted to feel that God
was hard in not letting her be strong like other girls;
but we now see that all the time He was fitting her
for the wonderful future before her; and when she
became Mrs. Booth, the great preacher, she herself
understood this.</p>

<p>&#8216;Being so much alone in my youth,&#8217; she
said, &#8217;and so thrown on my own thoughts and
on those expressed in books, has been very helpful
to me. Had I been given to gossip, and had there been
people for me to gossip with, I should certainly never
have accomplished what I did.&#8217;</p>

<p>So, you see, God was all the time giving her the very
best training He could, and teaching her, as she lay
there alone on her bed, what she never could have
learned in the ordinary way. And He will train you,
too, in the very best way for your future, if you
will but determine to trust and serve Him as did Catherine
Mumford.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_02"></a>II</h1>

<h2>Conversion and Soul Struggles</h2>

<p>&#8217;No soul was ever yet saved who was too idle
to seek.&#8217;&ndash;<i>Mrs</i>. <i>Booth</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps you, the Corps Cadet, for whom I am especially
writing this little book, have been tempted to break
your vows by becoming engaged to some one who does
not want to be an Officer. And you think, perhaps,
that no one understands your feelings.</p>

<p>You will be surprised, then, to know that our Army
Mother had just such a battle to fight when she was
a girl.</p>

<p>She had a cousin, a little older than herself, who
was tall and very clever. He came with his parents
to stay in her home, and Katie had not seen him since
they were young children. He quickly grew very fond
of his cousin, and Catherine found how nice it was
to have some one to give her presents and to love
her as he did. At last he begged her to promise that
by and by she would be engaged to him. Now Katie was
very perplexed. On the one hand she loved her cousin,
and did not want to grieve him, and yet in her heart
she knew he was not truly given up to God, and would
not help her in her soul.</p>

<p>&#8216;Go to the Meeting with you, Katie?&#8217; he
used to say. &#8217;Of course, I&#8217;ll go anywhere
to please you.&#8217; But then, while she was trying
to get a blessing, he would be scratching little pictures
on the back of the seat to make her laugh. Perhaps
you can guess the struggle it was for Katie to decide
what her answer should be. &#8217;If you will only
say &#8220;yes,&#8221; and be engaged to him, I am
sure you will be able to help him, and very likely
get him properly saved,&#8217; the Devil would whisper.
&#8217;Break it off now, Katie; do not go another
step; you know God cannot smile on it.&#8217; That
was how her conscience spoke.</p>

<p>At last, one day as she was truly praying and seeking
for light, she read the verse in 2 Corinthians vi.
14: &#8217;Be ye not unequally yoked together with
unbelievers.&#8217; It came to her as the voice of
God.</p>

<p>&#8216;I will do it, Lord,&#8217; she said, after
a long struggle; and she sat down, and wrote her cousin
a letter, telling him just why she could never be
engaged to him, and breaking it all off for ever. Then
she turned back to her home duties, and did not re-open
the question.</p>

<p>And did our Army Mother in after years regret that
she had acted like this? No, indeed; she has told
us that she saw plainly later on that, if just then
she had chosen to follow her own feelings and wishes,
instead of obeying God&#8217;s command, all her life
would have been altered, and she would never have
done the glorious work He had planned for her. It was
a hard battle at the time, and cost her many tears;
but it was worth it, ten thousand times over, as we
can all see to-day.</p>

<p>Very soon after this victory Catherine became really
converted.</p>

<p>&#8216;What!&#8217; you say. &#8216;Was she not converted
before this?&#8217;</p>

<p>No. All her life she had, like many children trained
to-day in Salvationist homes, felt God&#8217;s Holy
Spirit striving with her. Sometimes, when quite a
little girl, her mother would find her crying because
she felt how she had sinned against God.</p>

<p>But when she was about fifteen she longed to know
that she was really saved.</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t be silly,&#8217; said the Devil
in her heart. &#8217;You have been as good as saved
all your life. You have always wanted to do right.
How can you expect such a sudden change as if you
were a great big drunkard? It&#8217;s absurd.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But my <i>heart</i> is as bad as the heart
of a big sinner,&#8217; cried poor Katie in an agony
of fear. &#8217;I have been as bad inside, if not in
my outward actions and words.&#8217;</p>

<p>And then she took hold of God in faith. &#8217;Lord,
I must be converted. I cannot rest till Thou hast
changed my whole nature; do for me what Thou dost
do, for the thieves and drunkards.&#8217;</p>

<p>But for six weeks it seemed as if God did not hear
her cry. She grew more and more unhappy. All her past
sins rose before her: those bursts of temper when
she was at school, those wrong thoughts and feelings.
Yes, the Bible was true when it said: &#8217;The heart
is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked.&#8217;</p>

<p>Katie argued, too, like this: &#8217;I cannot recollect
any time or place where I claimed Salvation and the
forgiveness of my sins; if God <i>has</i> saved
me, He would surely have made me certain of it. Anyway,
I must and will know it. I must have the assurance
that I am God&#8217;s child.&#8217;</p>

<p>Unable to rest, she would pace her room till two o&#8217;clock
in the morning, and would lie down at last, with her
Bible and hymn-book under her pillow, praying that
God would Himself tell her that her sins were forgiven.
At last, one morning, as she woke, she opened her hymn-book,
and read these words:&ndash;</p>

<p align="center">My God, I am Thine,<br />
What a comfort divine,<br />
What a blessing to know that my Jesus is mine.</p>

<p>Now she had read and sung these lines scores of times
before, but they came this morning with a new power
to her soul.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am Thine!&#8217; &#8216;My Jesus is mine!&#8217;
she exclaimed. &#8217;Lord, it is true!&ndash;I do believe
it! My sins are forgiven. I belong to Thee!&#8217;
and her whole soul was filled with light and joy.
She now possessed what she had been seeking all these
weeks&ndash;the assurance of Salvation! And then what do
you think she did? She threw on a wrapper, and, without
waiting to dress, hurried across to her mother&#8217;s
room, and tapped at the door.</p>

<p>&#8216;Come in,&#8217; said her mother&#8217;s voice;
and Katie, her face shining with joy, burst into the
room. &#8217;Mamma, mamma, I am a child of God! My
sins are forgiven&ndash;Jesus is my Saviour!&#8217; she
cried, flinging herself into her mother&#8217;s arms.
And this was the same Katie, who had been so shy and
backward that she had never before dared to speak about
her spiritual anxieties, even to her mother! Ah! what
a change real conversion, or change of heart, had
made.</p>

<p>For the next six months Katie was so happy that she
felt as if she were walking on air. &#8216;I used
to tremble,&#8217; she tells us, &#8217;and even long
to die, lest I should back-slide or lose the sense
of God&#8217;s favour.&#8217;</p>

<p>But as time went on she learned, as we all have to
do, to walk by faith, not by sight, and to serve and
follow the Saviour whether she had happy feelings
or not.</p>

<p>But you must not suppose, because Katie had the assurance
of Salvation, that therefore she had no more fighting.
No&ndash;indeed, her fighting days had only just begun.</p>

<p>One of her great difficulties, which many Corps Cadets
will understand, was that she felt so nervous about
doing anything in public. No one, of course, asked
her to speak&ndash;such a thing was never dreamed of; but
the lady who took the Bible Class which she attended
regularly would now and then ask her to pray. &#8216;Miss
Mumford will pray,&#8217; the lady would say, when
they were all kneeling together.</p>

<p>But Katie was too shy to begin, and sometimes they
would wait for several minutes before she had courage
to say a few words. &#8217;Don&#8217;t ask me to pray
again,&#8217; she said one day to her leader; &#8217;the
excitement and agitation make me quite ill.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I can&#8217;t help that,&#8217; was the very
wise answer; &#8217;you must break through your timidity;
for otherwise you will be of no use to God.&#8217;</p>

<p>And did Katie persevere? Yes, indeed, she did. Here
is an entry made some time later in the diary that
she kept, which shows you how very much her experience
was like yours:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;I have not been blessed so much for weeks as
I was to-night. I prayed aloud.  The cross was great,
but so was the reward.</p>

<p>My heart beat violently, but I felt some liberty.&#8217;</p>

<p>Though Catherine&#8217;s spine difficulty was better,
she was still very delicate, and at the age of eighteen
every one felt sure she was going into a decline.
But, sick or well, her soul grew stronger, and her
desire to please and serve God better increased every
day.</p>

<p>&#8216;I do love Thee,&#8217; she wrote in the same
little diary, &#8217;but I want to love Thee more.&#8217;</p>

<p>It was not till many years later that Catherine received
the blessing of a clean heart; but even now she had
begun to desire and long for it. She also writes at
this time: &#8217;I see that this Full Salvation is
very necessary if I am to glorify God below, and find
my way to Heaven. I want a <i>clean</i> heart.
Lord, take me and seal me.&#8217;</p>

<p>Some people, even after they are converted, are too
proud to own themselves wrong, or to confess when
they have sinned.  Catherine was not of that sort.
In one of her letters to her mother she ends with these
words:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;Pray for me, dear mother, and believe me, with
all my faults and besetments, your loving child.&#8217;</p>

<p>Her hunger after a holy life was real and practical.
She knew she must learn to live by method&ndash;that is,
doing right, whether she liked it or not&ndash;and not
by feelings, if she was to be of use in the world.</p>

<p>So at the end of the year she wrote some new resolutions;
and as they may be of help to you, I will copy them
for you just as she put them down:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;I have been writing a few daily rules for the
coming year, which I hope will prove a blessing to
me, by the grace of God. I have got a paper of printed
rules also, which I intend to read once a week. May
the Lord help me to keep to them! But, above all,
I am determined to search the Scriptures more attentively,
for in them I have eternal life. I have read my Bible
through twice during the past sixteen months, but I
must read it with more prayer for light and understanding.
Oh, may it be my meat and drink! May I meditate on
it day and night! And then I shall bring forth fruit
in season; my leaf also shall not wither, and whatsoever
I do shall prosper.&#8217;</p>

<p>She had also her own private ways of denying herself,
not for the sake of earning money or praise by it,
but simply because she felt it was right. One of these
rules was to do without dinner, and butter at breakfast,
once in the week, because she felt it helped her in
her soul.</p>

<p>I cannot end this chapter without telling you of the
one great sorrow which darkened all her early years.
Some of you, I know, will enter into her feelings
so well.</p>

<p>Her father, at one time saved and earnest about the
souls of others, had grown cold and backslidden, and
now never even went near a Meeting. You can fancy
what agony this was to both Mrs. Mumford and her daughter.
They prayed and wept in vain&ndash;he only seemed to get
more indifferent. Catherine would sometimes write
her feelings and her sorrow in her diary, and there
we read:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;I sometimes get into an agony of feeling while
praying for my dear father. Oh, my Lord, answer prayer,
and bring him back to Thyself! Never let that tongue
which once delighted in praising Thee, and in showing
others Thy willingness to save, be engaged in uttering
the lamentations of the lost! Oh, awful thought! Lord,
have mercy! Save, Oh! save him in any way Thou seest
best, though it be ever so painful. If by removing
me Thou canst do this, cut short Thy work, and take
me Home. Let me be bold to speak in Thy name. Oh,
give me true courage and liberty, and when I write
to him, bless what I say to the good of his soul!&#8217;</p>

<p>For many years this prayer of Catherine&#8217;s was
not answered; but she held on, as you must do for
those you love, in faith and prayer; and at last she
had the unspeakable joy of seeing her dear father come
back to God through one of her own Meetings which
he had attended. His last years were full of peace,
and were spent in serving God and rejoicing in His
Salvation.</p>

<h2>A Three-Years Engagement</h2>

<p>&#8217;What a need there is for effort and energy;
or real religion and common sense!&#8217;&ndash;<i>Mrs</i>.
<i>Booth</i>.</p>

<p>One Sunday, when Catherine and her mother went to
the Meeting as usual, they found a &#8216;Special&#8217;
there, taking the services. He was quite different
from the other Specials, and Catherine could not help
noticing him with extra interest. He spoke to the
people&#8217;s hearts, and was not so much occupied
in preaching a good sermon as in getting some one converted.
But he did preach a very good sermon for all that,
and chose this verse as his text&ndash;&#8217;This is indeed
the Christ, the Saviour of the world.&#8217;</p>

<p>A few days later Catherine and her mother were spending
the evening with a friend, when the very same preacher
came in, and was introduced to them as the Rev. William
Booth.</p>

<p>Catherine knew they had one subject in common&ndash;love
for souls; but before the evening ended she discovered
that the young minister was quite as earnest as she
was herself in fighting the Drink curse and all that
was connected with it.</p>

<p>A few Sundays later Mr. Booth preached again in the
same building, this time as the minister, or, as we
should say, &#8216;Officer in charge,&#8217; and no
longer as a Special. And now you will guess that the
two often met, and that, because they had so many
interests in common, they soon learned to know each
other well, till respect grew into friendship, and
friendship into love.</p>

<p>Catherine was at this time twenty-two years old, and
Mr. Booth was three months younger; but, though you
would have said they were old enough to know their
own minds, they did nothing hastily, and would enter
into no engagement till they were quite sure of God&#8217;s
Will in the matter.</p>

<p>Had Catherine ever before thought of the day when
she would get married? you, perhaps, ask. Oh, yes,
indeed, and when but a girl of sixteen&ndash;directly,
in fact, after she was saved&ndash;she settled in her own
heart what sort of a man her future husband must be.
First, she decided, he must be truly converted, and
a total abstainer, not to please her, but from his
own choice. Then he must be a man of sense, or she
could never respect him; and, if they were to be happy,
they must feel and think alike on all important matters.</p>

<p>Ah, if our women-Soldiers and Cadets to-day would
but follow our Army Mother&#8217;s example, there
would be fewer unhappy marriages and wrecked lives!</p>

<p>But in her secret heart Catherine had also, girl-like,
some ideas about the sort of man she would like to
marry, if she might choose. He should be a minister&ndash;that
was the nearest she could get to an Officer in those
days; William was a name she particularly liked, and&ndash;if
only he might be tall and dark! If you had been there
when Katie Mumford first listened to his preaching
you would have seen that he was &#8216;tall and dark&#8217;
indeed.</p>

<p>But though William Booth loved Catherine with a deep
and holy love, which increased each time they met,
yet he was very poor, and he wondered if he ought,
under the circumstances, to ask her to share his lot.
He wrote a letter to her, telling her how perplexed
and troubled he was, and her answer shows us that,
right from the very earliest days, before they were
even engaged, her one desire was that his soul should
prosper.</p>

<p>&#8216;My dear friend,&#8217; she begins ... &#8217;The
thought that I should cause you any suffering or increase
your perplexity is almost unbearable. I am tempted
to wish that we had never seen each other. Do try to
forget me, as far as the remembrance would injure
your usefulness or spoil your peace. If I have no
alternative but to oppose the Will of God, or trample
on the desolations of my own heart, <i>my choice
is made</i>. &#8220;Thy will be done&#8221; is
my constant cry. I care not for myself; but Oh, if
I cause you to err, I shall never be happy again.&#8217;</p>

<p>It was not the fear of poverty that frightened her,
for a few days later she says:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;I fear you did not fully understand my difficulty.
It was not circumstances. I thought I had assured
you that a bright prospect would not allure me, nor
a dark one affright me, if only we are <i>one in
heart</i>.</p>

<p>My only reason for wishing to defer the engagement
was that <i>you</i> might feel satisfied in your
mind that the step is right.... If you are convinced
on this point, let circumstances go, and let us be
one, come what may.&#8217;</p>

<p>This is exactly what they did, and after meeting,
and together consecrating their lives to God, they
solemnly pledged themselves to each other.</p>

<p>And now began a three-years&#8217; engagement, in
which, though often for long months at a time they
never met, they remained true to each other and to
God, in thought and word and deed.</p>

<p>Many of the beautiful letters that our Army Mother
wrote to The General at this time, I am glad to tell
you, have been kept, and we will look together at
some of the ways in which she tried to help and cheer
him.</p>

<p>In the first letter after their engagement she ends
with these words:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;The more you lead me up to Christ in all things,
the more highly shall I esteem you; and if it be possible
to love you more than I do now, the more shall I love
you. You are always present in my thoughts.&#8217;</p>

<p>Now you must not think that, even in these early days,
our General had a very easy life. He was often much
perplexed and troubled, longing above all to do God&#8217;s
Will for the Salvation of the people, and yet not quite
sure what that Will was. At these times Catherine was
of untold help to him.</p>

<p>Once he was very unsettled&ndash;not certain whether he
should remain away in the North of England, or accept
a place in London, where the two could often meet.
Most girls would have said, &#8217;Oh, come, then we
shall be near to each other&#8217;; but you will see
that her advice to him is just as suitable for you
when you are not certain of your duty&ndash;that she does
not consider her own feelings at all.</p>

<p>&#8216;I wish,&#8217; she writes, &#8217;you prayed
more and talked less about the matter. Try it, and
be determined to get clear and settled views as to
your course. Leave your heart before God, and get
satisfied in His sight, and then do it, be it what
it may. I cannot bear the idea of your being unhappy.
Pray do in this as you feel in your soul it will be
right. My conscience is no standard for yours.&#8217;</p>

<p>Then she adds, lower down:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;Oh, if you come to London, let us be determined
to reap a blessed harvest. Let our fellowship be sanctified
to our souls&#8217; everlasting good. My mind is made
up to do my part towards it. I hope to be firm as a
rock on some points. The Lord help me. We must aim
to improve each other&#8217;s mind and character.
Let us pray for grace to do it in the best way and
to the fullest extent possible.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Anyway,&#8217; she says, a day or two later&ndash;and
ever remember her words when outside things try and
distress you&ndash;&#8217;don&#8217;t let the controversy
hurt your soul. Live near to God by prayer.... You
believe He answers prayer. Then take courage. Just
fall down at His feet, and open your very soul before
Him, and throw yourself right into His arms. Tell Him
that if you are wrong you only wait to be set right,
and, be the path rough or smooth, you will walk in
it.</p>

<p>&#8217;Oh, you must live close to God! If you are
a greater distance from Him than you were, just stop
the whirl of outward things, or rather leave it, and
shut yourself up with Him till all is clear and bright
upwards. Do, there&#8217;s a dear. Oh, how much we
lose by not coming to the point. Now, at once, realize
your union with Christ, and trust Him to lead you through
this perplexity. Bless you. Excuse this advice. I am
anxious for your soul. Look up. If God hears my prayers,
He must guide you&ndash;He will guide you.&#8217;</p>

<p>In these early days our General was tempted, as some
of us are tempted to-day, to feel nervous and shy
when talking before large crowds, and where the people
were better dressed and better off than usual. He wrote
his feelings to Catherine, and she sends him back her
wise advice and help. &#8216;I am sorry for this,&#8217;
she says, &#8217;and am persuaded it is the fear of
man which shackles you. Do not give place to this feeling.
Remember you are <i>the</i> Lord&#8217;s servant,
and if you are a faithful one it will be a small matter
with you to be judged of man&#8217;s judgment. Let
nothing be wanting beforehand to make what you say
helpful, but when you are before the people try to
think only of your own responsibility to Him who hath
sent you.&#8217;</p>

<p>Again, later, she writes:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;Try and cast off the fear of man. Fix your
eyes simply on the glory of God, and care not for
frown or praise of man. Rest not till your soul is
fully alive to God.&#8217; How truly she herself carried
this out in her own Meetings you will hear later on.</p>

<p>Miss Mumford was very anxious that The General should
improve himself with plenty of hard work. She saw
what he might become, and she also knew that unless
he did <i>his</i> part all those wonderful powers
which God had lent to him would be thrown away.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do assure me,&#8217; she writes, &#8217;my
own dear William, that no want of energy or effort
on your part shall hinder the improvement of those
talents God has given you.&#8217;</p>

<p>So that, with his constant travelling and preaching,
he might get time to read and think and learn, she
suggested a little plan to him in his billets.</p>

<p>&#8216;Could you not,&#8217; she says, &#8217;provide
yourself with a small leather bag or case, large enough
to hold your Bible and any other book you might require&ndash;pens,
ink, paper and a candle? And, presuming that you generally
have a room to yourself, could you not rise by six
o&#8217;clock every morning, and convert your bedroom
into a study till breakfast time?... I hope, my dearest
love, you will consider this plan, and keep to it,
if possible, as a general practice. Don&#8217;t let
little difficulties prevent your carrying it out.&#8217;</p>

<p>You must remember that at this time neither Catherine
nor Mr. Booth ever dreamed of the wonderful work they
were to be called to do. He was then preaching and
getting souls saved, mostly in country places, and
had many a &#8216;hard go,&#8217; but <i>that</i>
was no reason why he should not improve.</p>

<p>Did The General like this advice and counsel? Or did
he feel, as some men do to-day, that women cannot
judge nor understand such things?</p>

<p>Ah! he was wise, and only too glad to have all the
help that Catherine could give him. In fact, he often
wrote begging her to help him more. The outlines for
addresses which she sent him weekly he valued and used,
as this letter shows:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8216;I have,&#8217; he writes, &#8217;just taken
hold of that sketch you sent me on &#8220;Be not deceived,&#8221;
and am about to make a full sermon on it. I like it
much. It is admirable.</p>

<p>&#8217;I want a sermon on the Flood, one on Jonah,
and one on the Judgment. Send me some bare thoughts,
some clear, startling outlines. We must have that
kind of truth which will move sinners.&#8217;</p>

<p>But if Catherine Mumford was anxious about the mind
and work of her future husband, much more was she
anxious about his soul. To her, there could be no
true love without faithfulness, and where she felt
it necessary, she cautioned him in the truest and
tenderest way:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8216;You have special need,&#8217; she writes, &#8217;for
watchfulness and for much private intercourse with
God.</p>

<p>&#8217;My dearest love, beware how you indulge that
dangerous element of character, ambition. Misdirected,
it will be everlasting ruin to yourself, and perhaps
to me also. Oh, my love, let nothing earthly excite
it; let not the wish to be great fire it. Fix it on
the Throne of the Eternal, and let it find the realization
of its loftiest aspirations in the promotion of His
glory, and it shall be consummated with the richest
enjoyments and brightest glories of God&#8217;s own
Heaven.&#8217;</p>

<p>You wonder, perhaps, if Catherine ever wrote &#8216;love
letters,&#8217; as we call them. She never wrote the
foolish and sentimental letters which say a great
deal, and mean very little; but she was able to put
her great love into words strong, intense, and full
of tenderness.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do I remember?&#8217; she asks in one letter.
&#8217;Yes, I remember all&ndash;all that has bound us
together. All the bright and happy, as well as the
clouded and sorrowful times of our fellowship. Nothing
relating to you can time or place erase from my memory.
Your words, your looks, your actions, even the most
trivial and incidental, come up before me as fresh
as life. If I meet a child called William, I am more
interested in him than in any other. Bless you. Keep
your spirits up, and hope much for the future. God
lives and loves us, and we shall be one in Him, loving
each other as Christ loved us.&#8217;</p>

<p>William Booth and Catherine Mumford were married in
London, on June 15, 1855; and here are a few lines
from the last letter she wrote to him before the engagement
was ended, and the long thirty-five years of happy
married life began:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;I long to see you. Your letters do not satisfy
the yearnings of my heart. Perhaps they ought to.
I wish it were differently constituted. I might be
much happier. But it <i>will</i> be extravagant
and enthusiastic in spite of all my schooling. If
I ever get to Heaven, what rapture shall I know! No,
there is no fear of our loving each other too much.
How can we love each other more than Christ has loved
us? And this is the standard He has given us. What
a precious thing is the religion of Jesus! It makes
our first duties our highest happiness. It has the
promise of the life that now is, as well as of that
which is to come. We will spend all our energies in
trying to persuade men to receive and practise it.&#8217;</p>

<p>How wonderfully she carried this intention into practice,
and, together with The General, lived every moment
&#8216;publishing the Sinner&#8217;s Friend,&#8217;
you shall read later on.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_04"></a>IV</h1>

<h2>A Life of Sacrifice</h2>

<p>&#8217;Since I came to the crucifixion of myself,
I have not cared much what men might say of me.&#8217;&ndash;<i>Mrs. Booth</i>.</p>

<p>At the time when our Army Mother married The General&#8217;s
work was, as we have seen, that of an &#8216;Evangelist&#8217;
or &#8216;Travelling Minister.&#8217; He would stay
in a town for some weeks or months, as the case might
be, preaching and holding Meetings, and getting people
saved, both in the town itself and the places round.</p>

<p>It was a blessed and useful life, but very wearying;
and we can fancy how trying it must have been for
Mrs. Booth after her marriage not to have any home
of her own, but to billet first in one stranger&#8217;s
house, and then in another&#8217;s.</p>

<p>But she did not complain, though we see what it cost
her by a letter she writes to her mother, telling
the good news that they are to live in lodgings while
at Sheffield:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8216;You cannot think,&#8217; she writes, &#8217;with
what joy I look forward to being to ourselves once
more. For though I get literally oppressed with kindness,
I must say I would prefer a home where we could sit
down together at our own little table, myself the
mistress, and my husband the only guest. But the work
of God so abundantly prospers that I dare not repine,
or else I feel this constant packing and unpacking
and staying amongst strangers to be a great burden,
especially while so weak and poorly. But then I have
many mercies and advantages. My precious William is
all I desire, and without this what would the most
splendid home be but a glittering bauble?&#8217;</p>

<p>For several years Mrs. Booth travelled in this way
from place to place, helping, cheering, and encouraging
her husband in his soul-saving campaigns. She felt
her duty lay here, and even when she had a little son
to care for, she was unwilling to settle down. Writing
to her mother, who urged her to leave off this trying
life; or, at any rate, to hand the baby over to her,
she says:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;My objection to leaving William gets stronger
as I see the need he has of my presence, care, and
sympathy; neither is he willing for it himself. Nor
can I make up my mind to parting with Willie.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mrs. Booth&#8217;s object was to be a help to her
husband&ndash;not a hindrance; to push him forward in his
soul-saving work&ndash;not to hold him back; and therefore,
instead of rejoicing, as most wives and mothers would
have done, when a settled home and work were offered
him, she was doubtful.</p>

<p>&#8216;Personally considered,&#8217; she writes to
her mother, &#8217;I care nothing about it. I feel
that a good rest in one place will be a boon to us.
Anyhow, if God wills him to be an Evangelist, He will
open the way. I find that I love the work itself far
more than I thought I did, and I am willing to risk
something for it.&#8217;</p>

<p>After this came several years of great conflict and
struggle. The Conference (or, as we would say, Headquarters)
under whom The General worked did not wish him to
continue the great Salvation Campaigns for which God
had so marvellously fitted him. They wanted him to
&#8217;settle down,&#8217; and spend perhaps several
years in one place like ordinary ministers.</p>

<p>To please those who were over him he did this, and
spent four years in one town. But though God blessed
his efforts, The General was convinced that he was
called to greater things. He loved the sinners; wherever
he went crowds flocked to hear him, and the vilest
were converted. Was it God&#8217;s will, therefore,
that he should sacrifice the work his soul loved,
and &#8216;settle down&#8217; into an ordinary life,
helping and reaching only the people of one small
city?</p>

<p>This question our Army Mother helped him to decide.
Try to picture her position. She had by this time
a family of little children, and her health was very
delicate. By counselling The General to &#8216;settle
down,&#8217; as his friends wished him to do, she
would have a nice home, a comfortable income, and,
above all, the constant presence of her husband, who
would no longer need to leave her on his long soul-saving
tours.</p>

<p>By refusing the position offered, and choosing instead
to take up the &#8216;evangelistic life&#8217; again,
The General turned his back on salary, home, and work,
and went out into the world, with his wife and four
children, friendless and alone. Do you wonder that
the struggle was a severe one?</p>

<p>&#8216;Pray for me,&#8217; she wrote to her mother,
when the question was about to be settled. &#8217;I
have many a conflict in regard to the proposed new
departure; not as to our support&ndash;I feel as though
I can trust the Lord implicitly for all that; but
the Devil tells me I shall never be able to endure
the loneliness and separation of the life. He draws
many a picture of most dark and melancholy shade.
But I cling to the promise, &#8220;No man hath forsaken,&#8221;
<i>etc</i>., and, having sworn to my own hurt, may I
stand fast. I have told William that if he takes the
step, and it should bring me to the workhouse, I would
never say one upbraiding word. No. To blame him for
making such a sacrifice for God and conscience&#8217;
sake would be worse than wicked. So, whatever be the
result, I shall make up my mind to endure it patiently,
looking to the Lord for grace and strength.&#8217;</p>

<p>But if it was difficult for Mrs. Booth, the path was
equally dark and hard for The General.</p>

<p>&#8216;William hesitates,&#8217; she writes a few
weeks later. &#8217;He thinks of me and the children,
and I appreciate his love and care. But I tell him
that God will provide, if he will only go straight
on in the path of duty. It is strange that I, who
always used to shrink from the sacrifice, should be
the first in making it. But when I made the surrender
I did it whole-heartedly, and ever since I have been
like another being. Oh, pray for us yet more and more!
We have no money coming in from any quarter now. Nor
has William any invitations at present. The time is
unfavourable. I am much tempted to feel it hard that
God has not cleared our path more satisfactorily.
But I will not &#8220;charge God foolishly.&#8221;
I know that His way is often in the whirlwind, and
He rides upon the storm: I will try to possess my
soul in patience, and to wait on Him.&#8217;</p>

<p>Sometimes you have heard your Officers talking in
a Meeting, and telling the people that, if they will
but step out in faith, and do right, God will open
up the way for them. The example of our General and
Army Mother has taught us this lesson, for few ever
took a step of faith into greater darkness and difficulty
than they did at this time.</p>

<p>&#8216;My dearest,&#8217; writes Mrs. Booth to her
mother, &#8217;is starting for London. Pray for him.
He is much harassed. But I have promised to keep a
brave heart. At times it appears to me that God may
have something very glorious in store for us, and
when He has tried us He will bring us forth as gold.
It will not be the first time I have taken a leap in
the dark, humanly speaking, for conscience&#8217;
sake.&#8217;</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a &#8216;leap in the dark&#8217;:
to break up their little home in the North, and, travelling
by boat, to save expense, to bring their four children
to Mrs. Mumford&#8217;s house in London. There they
separated: the father and mother went to Cornwall,
to hold a Salvation campaign in a little chapel that
had been lent to them, and the children remained behind.</p>

<p>Of the marvellous way in which God blessed the Cornish
work, I cannot stop to tell you. Mrs. Booth&#8217;s
name as a preacher was by this time becoming as widely
known as that of her husband; and they went from one
place to another, at first together, and then, afterwards,
separately, so as to be able to do more good, for
four long years.</p>

<p>Whenever possible, our Army Mother took her children
with her: she never left them to others when she could
help it, and later on I shall tell you what a devoted
and tender mother she was; but the strain of those
four long years no one will ever know. I want you
to see the dark as well as the bright side of her
wonderful life; and here is part of a letter to her
mother, written at that time:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;I feel dreadfully unsettled at present. I don&#8217;t
like this mode of living at all. William has now been
away from home, except on Friday and Saturday, for
twelve weeks. I long to get fixed together again once
more. The going backwards and forwards and being in
other people&#8217;s houses does not suit William.
Nor do I like leaving home for the Sabbaths. I am much
tempted to look gloomily towards the future. But &#8220;my
heart is fixed.&#8221; &#8220;I will trust, and not
be afraid."&#8217;</p>

<p>Then again, a little later on:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;Pray for me. I sometimes feel as though I had
taken a path which is too hard for me, and duties
too heavy for me to perform; but it is my privilege
to say, and to feel, &#8220;I can do all things through
Christ which strengtheneth me."&#8217;</p>

<p>Once again she says:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;Well, the Lord help us to be faithful to our
convictions, even in the dark and cloudy day! I have
felt it hard work to do so lately. Many a time have
I longed to be where the weary are at rest.</p>

<p>&#8217;Well, we must labour and wait a little longer;
it may be that the clouds will break, and surround
us with sunshine. Anyway, God lives above the clouds,
and He will direct our path.&#8217;</p>

<p>The General and Mrs. Booth were holding Salvation
services in London when our Army Mother was called
to make a fresh sacrifice, never dreaming of the wonderful
results that would spring from it. You shall read about
it in her own words, spoken many years afterwards:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8216;I remember well,&#8217; she says, &#8217;when
The General decided at last to give up the evangelistic
life and to devote himself to the Salvation of the
East-Enders. He had come home from a Meeting one
night, tired out, as usual. It was between eleven
and twelve o&#8217;clock. Flinging himself into an
easy chair, he said to me, &#8220;O Kate, as I passed
by the doors of the flaming gin-palaces to-night I
seemed to hear a voice sounding in my ears, &#8217;Where
can you go and find such heathen as these, and where
is there so great a need for your labours?&#8217;
And I felt as though I ought at every cost to stop
and preach to these East-End crowds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8217;I remember the emotion that this produced in
my soul. I sat gazing into the fire, and the Devil
whispered to me, &#8220;This means another new departure&ndash;another
start in life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8217;The question of our support I saw at once to
be a serious difficulty. Hitherto we had been able
to meet our expenses by the collections which we had
made from our respectable audiences. But it was impossible
to suppose that we could do so among the poverty-stricken
East-Enders. We did not then see things as we do to-day.
We were afraid even to ask for a collection among
the East London crowds.</p>

<p>&#8217;Nevertheless, I did not answer discouragingly.
After a moment&#8217;s pause for thought and prayer,
I answered, &#8220;Well, if you feel you ought to stay,
stay. We have trusted the Lord once for our support,
and we can trust Him again."&#8217;</p>

<p>Mrs. Booth, when she answered like this, had no idea
of all that was to follow. She never dreamt that,
from The General&#8217;s standing alone in Whitechapel,
a mighty wave of Salvation would sweep over the earth,
nor that God was about to raise up an Army of which
she and The General were to be the leaders.</p>

<p>But, as always before, she willingly agreed to whatever
would be for God&#8217;s glory and the Salvation of
souls; and we all know to-day how, from that little
Whitechapel beginning, grew the Christian Mission,
and how, at last, the Christian Mission became The
Salvation Army.</p>

<p>Do not think, however, that our dear Army Mother&#8217;s
consecration stopped here! No, indeed. One by one,
as they became old enough, she gave up her children
to the Work, and we shall never know all we owe as
an Army to her beautiful spirit of devotion and sacrifice.</p>

<p>Let us stand together by her open grave in the autumn
twilight. Her twenty-six years of fight and toil in
The Salvation Army are over now, her spirit has been
summoned Home. Listen. The Army Founder himself is
the speaker. He is recalling the forty years which
he and our dear Army Mother had trod together, and
his words sum up better than any other words could
do what she was to our Leader:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8216;If you had had a tree,&#8217; he said, speaking
to the vast crowd that stood round the grave, &#8217;that
had grown up in your garden, under your window, which
for forty years had been your shadow from the burning
sun, whose flowers had been the adornment and beauty
of your life, whose fruit had been almost the stay
of your existence, and the gardener had come along
and swung his glittering axe and cut it down before
your eyes, I think you would feel as though you had
a blank&ndash;it might not be a big one&ndash;but a little blank
in your life.</p>

<p>&#8217;If you had had a servant who for all this long
time had served you without fee or reward, who had
administered, for very love, to your health and comfort,
and who suddenly passed away, you would miss that
servant.</p>

<p>&#8217;If you had had a counsellor who, in hours&ndash;continually
occurring&ndash;of perplexity and amazement, had ever advised
you, and seldom advised wrong; whose advice you had
followed, and seldom had reason to regret it; and
the counsellor, while you were in the same intricate
mazes of your existence, had passed away, you would
miss that counsellor.</p>

<p>&#8217;If you had had a friend who had understood
your very nature, the rise and fall of your feelings,
the bent of your thoughts, and the purpose of your
existence; a friend whose communion had ever been pleasant&ndash;the
most pleasant of all other friends&ndash;to whom you had
ever turned with satisfaction, and your friend had
been taken away, you would feel some sorrow at the
loss.</p>

<p>&#8217;If you had had a mother for your children who
had cradled and nursed and trained them for the service
of the living God, in which you most delighted&ndash;a
mother, indeed, who had never ceased to bear their
sorrows on her heart, and who had been ever willing
to pour forth that heart&#8217;s blood in order to
nourish them, and that darling mother had been taken
from your side, you would feel it a sorrow.</p>

<p>&#8217;If you had had a wife, a sweet love of a wife,
who for forty years had never given you real cause
for grief; a wife who had stood with you, side by
side, in the battle&#8217;s front, who had been a comrade
to you, ever willing to interpose herself between
you and the enemy, and ever the strongest when the
battle was fiercest, and your beloved one had fallen
before your eyes, I am sure there would be some excuse
for your sorrow.</p>

<p>&#8217;Well, my comrades, you can roll all these qualities
into one personality, and what would be lost in all
I have lost in one. There has been taken away from
me the light of my eyes, the inspiration of my soul,
and we are about to lay all that remains of her in
the grave. I have been looking right at the bottom
of it here, and calculating how soon they may bring
and lay me alongside of her, and my cry to God has
been that every remaining hour of my life may make
me readier to come and join her in death, to go and
embrace her in life in the Eternal City.&#8217;</p>

<h2>The Speaker</h2>

<p>&#8217;I will never speak to sinners so that one man
or woman in my audience can stand up and say, &#8220;You
might have warned me more faithfully, spoken more
plainly than you did.&#8221; I would rather die than
that should be the case.&#8217;&mdash;<i>Mrs. Booth</i>.</p>

<p>No one must think that Mrs. Booth became a great speaker
all in a moment, or by any &#8216;royal road.&#8217;
She started when about eighteen, as many a Corps Cadet
has since done, by just taking a class or Company on
Sundays, never dreaming of doing more. An elder girls&#8217;
Company was given to her; and she had fifteen girls
to teach, whose ages varied from twelve to nineteen.</p>

<p>Two half-days she spent every week in preparing for
her Company, and in trying to make each lesson end
in a practical way, so as to do them real good.</p>

<p>Then on Sunday, when the rest of the children had
been dismissed, Miss Mumford would beg to be given
the key of the room and would remain behind, holding
a little Prayer Meeting with her girls. Sometimes they
would stay on for an hour and a half, and many by this
means became truly converted.</p>

<p>Often with so much praying and singing Catherine quite
lost her voice before the end of the Meeting; but,
so long as souls were saved, she did not mind that.</p>

<p>Soon after her marriage Mrs. Booth took another class
of this same kind, and also a little sort of Sergeants&#8217;
Meeting, and then&ndash;for you see our Army Mother was
led on, just as you or I may be, step by step&ndash;she
gave a short talk to the Band of Hope children (something
like our Band of Love of today) on the evils of drink.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, how I wish,&#8217; she wrote to her father,
&#8217;that I had started speaking years ago!&#8217;</p>

<p>A little later on Mr. and Mrs. Booth moved to Gateshead,
and there the people were very much surprised to hear
their minister&#8217;s wife pray aloud when her husband
had done speaking; for in those days very few women
thought of praying, much less of speaking, in public.</p>

<p>&#8217;Since you can pray so beautifully, will you
come and talk to us on our special Prayer-Meeting
night?&#8217; some of the people asked. But Mrs. Booth
was horrified.</p>

<p>&#8216;Of course, I said &#8220;No,"&#8217; she wrote.
&#8217;I don&#8217;t know what they can be thinking
of.&#8217;</p>

<p>Just at this time an argument began in one of the
newspapers as to whether women had the right to speak
for God or not. Mrs. Booth wrote an answer to this
question you can read it for yourself in her book,
&#8217;Practical Religion&#8217;&ndash;and she showed from
God&#8217;s Word, that women have the same right to
help to get people saved that the men have. The little
pamphlet was already printed and being widely read,
and our Army Mother lay alone in her room very ill,
when the thought flashed into her soul, &#8217;You
have been helping other women to preach and to speak
for God. What about yourself?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8217;Oh, no, Lord, not me; I can&#8217;t. I am,
as Thou knowest, the most timid and bashful disciple
ever saved by grace.&#8217; That was her answer.</p>

<p>Then the Lord took her back to the days when she first
gave herself to Him, at the age of fifteen. He showed
her that all the way along this one thing had hindered
and stopped her from &#8217;being the blessing or from
getting the blessing He intended.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Lord,&#8217; she cried, &#8217;if Thou wilt
come back to me as in the old days, I will obey, though
I die in the attempt.&#8217;</p>

<p>But at the moment God seemed not to answer her cry,
and when she was well again all went on as before.</p>

<p>Three months later Mrs. Booth was quietly sitting
one Sunday morning in chapel with her eldest boy,
when a very wonderful thing happened. You shall read
about it in her own words:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8216;I felt much depressed in mind,&#8217; she says,
&#8217;and was not expecting anything particular,
but as the testimonies proceeded I felt the Holy Spirit
come upon me. It seemed as if a voice said to me: &#8220;Now,
if you were to go and testify, you know I would bless
it to your own soul as well as to the people!&#8221;
I gasped again, and said in my heart: &#8220;Yes, Lord,
I believe Thou wouldst, but I cannot do it!&#8221;
I had forgotten my vow.</p>

<p>&#8217;A moment afterwards there flashed across my
mind the memory of the time when I had promised the
Lord that I would obey Him at all costs. And then
the voice seemed to ask me if this was consistent with
that promise. I almost jumped up and said, &#8220;No,
Lord, it is the old thing over again. But I cannot
do it!&#8221; I felt as though I would sooner die than
speak. And then the Devil said, &#8220;Besides, you
are not prepared. You will look like a fool, and will
have nothing to say.&#8221; He made a mistake. He overreached
himself for once. It was this word that settled it.
&#8220;Ah!&#8221; I said, &#8220;this is just the
point. I have never yet been willing to be a fool for
Christ. Now I will be one!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8217;Without stopping another moment, I rose up
from my seat and walked down the aisle. My dear husband
thought something had happened to me, and so did the
people. We had been there two years, and they knew
my timid, bashful nature. He stepped down, and asked
me, &#8220;What is the matter, my dear?&#8221; I replied,
&#8220;I want to say a word!&#8221; He was so taken
by surprise that he could only say, &#8220;My dear
wife wishes to speak!&#8221; and sat down. For years
he had been trying to persuade me to do it. Only that
very week he had wanted me to go and address a little
Cottage Meeting of some twenty working people, but
I had refused.</p>

<p>&#8217;I stood&ndash;God only knows how&ndash;and if any mortal
ever did hang on the arm of Omnipotence, I did. I
just stood and told the people how it had come about.
I confessed, as I think everybody should who has been
in the wrong and has misrepresented the religion of
Jesus Christ. I said, &#8220;I dare say many of you
have been looking upon me as a very devoted woman,
and one who has been living faithfully to God. But
I have come to realize that I have been disobeying
Him, and thus brought darkness and leanness into my
soul. I have promised the Lord to do so no longer,
and have come to tell you that henceforth I will be
obedient to the holy vision.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8217;There was more weeping, they said, in the chapel
that day than on any previous occasion. Many dated
a renewal in righteousness from that very moment,
and began a life of devotion and consecration to God.</p>

<p>&#8217;Now I might have &#8220;talked good&#8221;
to them till now. That honest confession did what
twenty years of preaching could not have accomplished.&#8217;</p>

<p>After this wonderful victory Mrs. Booth never again
drew back. The same night she spoke once more, with
even greater power than in the morning, and before
long invitations came pouring in from all parts, for
wherever she went souls were saved and people sanctified.</p>

<p>But it cost her a great deal to preach like this.
She writes of one Meeting held soon after:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;I got on very well, and had three beautiful
cases, but I cannot tell you how I felt all day about
it. I could neither eat nor sleep. I never was in
such a state, and when I saw the people, I felt like
melting away. However, I got through.&#8217;</p>

<p>Even to the last, when she was known all round the
world as one of the greatest women-preachers of the
day, she never spoke without feeling deeply the responsibility
and importance of her work, nor without having prepared
carefully beforehand what she wanted to say.</p>

<p>It was very difficult for her, with four little children,
the eldest only four years and three months old, to
get enough time and quiet. We should have said it
was impossible, for she was not well off, and could
not afford to put her sewing out, or to have many
servants to work for her; but she says:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;God forced me to begin to think and work, and
He gave me grace and strength to do it. Many a time
while I was nursing my baby I was thinking of what
I should say next Sunday, and between times I noted
down with a pencil the thoughts as they struck me.
Then I would appear with an outline scratched in pencil,
trusting in the Lord to give me the power of His Holy
Spirit; and from the day I began He has never allowed
me to open my mouth without giving me signs of His
presence and blessing.&#8217;</p>

<p>The two books she always used in getting ready for
her Meetings were her Bible and Concordance.</p>

<p>In later years she taught her children how to prepare
for their Meetings, and some of the advice she gives
is very helpful to Corps Cadets.</p>

<p>&#8216;"Jesus wept,"&#8217; she writes to her eldest
girl, who was then fourteen, &#8217;would be a nice
subject for you at one of your little Meetings. And
you could find some texts to show how David wept,
and Daniel, and Jeremiah, <i>etc</i>., if you like it.
But don&#8217;t take it because <i>I</i> say so&ndash;you
must ask the Lord for your subjects.&#8217;</p>

<p>Later on, however, as The Salvation Army grew, Mrs.
Booth felt that, though it was just as necessary to
prepare, yet to speak from notes was often not helpful
to either the Officer or the people, so she writes
to one of her sons:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;Get out of them! They don&#8217;t fit our work.
When you get on, you don&#8217;t want them; and when
you don&#8217;t, they are no good. At first, if your
memory won&#8217;t serve you, just jot on a small
bit of paper the size of a ticket your main divisions
in large writing, but no more. Like this:&ndash;</p>

<blockquote>&#8217;Day of wrath is come.<br />
&#8217;1. God&#8217;s wrath.<br />
&#8217;2. Just wrath.<br />
&#8217;3. Uttermost wrath.<br />
&#8216;4. Eternal wrath.&#8217;</blockquote>

<p>On the platform Mrs. Booth&#8217;s manner was as simple
and natural as when by her own fireside; anything
&#8216;put on&#8217; or affected she hated.</p>

<p>&#8216;If I were asked,&#8217; she says, &#8217;to
put into one word what I consider to be the greatest
hindrance to the success of Divine truth, even when
spoken by sincere and real people, I should say <i>stiffness</i>.
Simplicity is indispensable to success, <i>naturalness</i>
in putting the truth. It seems as if people, the moment
they come to religion, put on a different tone, a
different look and manner&ndash;in short, become unnatural.&#8217;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Booth not only prepared for her Meetings
by thought and study, but she prepared most of all
by prayer.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, if we could,&#8217; she writes, &#8217;get
more of the spirit of prayer into those who love God!
Few understand it at all.</p>

<p>&#8217;I always find an exact proportion in the results
to the spirit of intercession I have had beforehand.
That is why I like to be alone in lodgings.&#8217;</p>

<p>Before her Meeting she would wrestle and plead with
God for hours, in tears and agony, and then would
face her congregation overflowing with love and faith.</p>

<p>&#8216;Pray for me,&#8217; she writes during her marvellous
Portsmouth campaign. &#8217;No one knows how I feel.
I think I never realized my responsibility as I did
on Sunday night. I felt really awful before rising
to speak. The sight almost overwhelmed me. With its
two galleries, its dome-like roof and vast proportions,
when crammed with people, the building presents a most
imposing appearance. The top gallery is ten or twelve
seats deep in front, and it was full of men. Such
a sight as I have never seen on any previous occasion.
Oh, how I <i>yearned</i> over them! I felt as
if it would be a small thing to die <i>there and
then</i>, if that would have brought them to Jesus.&#8217;</p>

<p>Nothing short of men and women getting converted satisfied
her.</p>

<p>&#8216;They say,&#8217; she writes of another campaign,
&#8217;the sinners here will &#8220;<i>bide some
bringing down</i>.&#8221; Well, the Lord can do
it. They tell me, too, that I am immensely popular
with the people. But <i>that</i> is no comfort
unless they will be saved.&#8217;</p>

<p>She laboured to get the truth home to the hearts of
her listeners, and that is why her talking was so
blessed.</p>

<p>&#8216;God made you responsible,&#8217; she said,
&#8217;not for delivering the truth, but for <strong class="smallcaps">getting it in</strong>&ndash;getting it home, fixing it in the conscience
as a red-hot iron, as a bolt, straight from His throne;
and He has given you also the <i>power to do it</i>;
and if you do not do it, <i>blood</i> will be
on your skirts. Oh, this genteel way of putting the
truth! How God hates it! &#8220;If you please, dear
friends, will you listen? If you please, will you
be converted? Will you come to Jesus? Shall we read
just this, that, and the other?&#8221; No more like
apostolic preaching than darkness is like light.&#8217;</p>

<p>How can I show you some of the marvellous results
of her preaching? In every part of our land her influence
and words made themselves felt; the largest buildings
were crowded with all classes of society, and glorious
cases of conversion and sanctification crowned her
labours everywhere. A lady who was at some of her
women&#8217;s Meetings at Lye, near Birmingham, tells
us:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;The women left their work, and in all sorts
of odd costumes flocked to the Meetings, some with
bonnets, some with shawls fastened over their head,
others with little children clinging to their necks.
All, with eager, inquiring faces, took their seats
and listened to the gracious words which fell from
the lips of dear Mrs. Booth. And when the invitation
was given, what a scene ensued! It baffles all description.
Crowding, weeping, rushing to the penitent-form came
convicted sinners and repentant backsliders. When
the form was filled the penitents dropped upon their
knees in the aisles or in their seats, so that it was
difficult to move about.&#8217;</p>

<p>When holding some Meetings in a Rotherhithe chapel
(for The Army was only just beginning its work, and
our Army Mother took Meetings in different churches
and chapels up and down the land), the victories were
just as glorious, and one of her Converts says:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;There were many remarkable cases of conversion
at these Meetings. Amongst others there were the two
daughters of a publican. When one sister was saved
the other went to hear Mrs. Booth on purpose to ridicule
the services. But she was seized with such an agonizing
realization of her sins that she came down from the
top of the gallery to the penitent-form, crying out
aloud, &#8220;I must come! I must come!&#8221; Soon
after their father gave up the public-house, and they
afterwards became members of Mr. Spurgeon&#8217;s
Tabernacle.</p>

<p>&#8217;I have seen as many as thirty persons seeking
Salvation in a single Meeting, and some years afterwards,
when I looked at the register of our chapel, I found
about one hundred names of those who had professed
to be converted at this time.&#8217;</p>

<p>Our Army Mother, too, was equally straight and fearless
with the rich when, later on, they also came in crowds
to hear her. She had but one message and one gospel
for all alike. She says, &#8217;By God&#8217;s help
I will not regard the person of man, but will plainly
and fearlessly declare the truth, come what may.&#8217;
God honoured this spirit, and her Meetings in the
West-End of London, where the great and rich live,
were some of the most glorious of her life. Of one
such she writes:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;The Lord has very graciously stood by me, and
given me much precious fruit. Last Sunday we had the
Hall crowded, and a large proportion of gentlemen.
The Lord was there in power, and twenty-one came forward&ndash;some
for Salvation and some for purity. Several were most
blessed cases of full surrender. We did not get away
till nearly six, and we began at three. Everybody
is amazed at this for the West-End! The audience is
very select, we never having published a bill. Pray
much, dear friend, that God may do a deep and permanent
work in this Babylon. It seems as though He gave me
words of fire for them, and they sat spellbound.&#8217;</p>

<p>You say you wish you had heard her speak? Indeed,
we all wish you had: you could never have forgotten
it. But several of her addresses were taken down in
shorthand at the time, and are reprinted in her books,
so you can get and read them; and they will bless
and teach you as they have taught thousands before
you.</p>

<h2>The Mother</h2>

<p>&#8217;A lady once said to me, &#8220;How have you
managed to get your children converted so early?&#8221;
&#8220;Oh,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I have been beforehand
with the Devil."&#8217;&mdash;<i>Mrs. Booth</i>.</p>

<p>I have already told you how Mrs. Booth had the true
mother spirit when but a little child, loving and
tending her dolls as if they had been real babies;
you will, therefore, guess that with her own children
she was the best and most careful of mothers. She
began early to train them in the right way, and never
left them unless forced to do so.</p>

<p>&#8216;I cannot part with Willie,&#8217; she writes
to her mother, who offered to free Mrs. Booth by taking
charge of the baby for her; &#8217;first, because I
know the child&#8217;s affections could not but be
weaned from us; and secondly, because the next year
will be the most important of his life with reference
to managing his will; and in this I cannot but distrust
you. I know, my darling mother, you could not wage
war with his self-will so resolutely as to subdue
it. And then my child would be ruined, for he must
be taught implicit, uncompromising obedience.&#8217;</p>

<p>But long before writing this she had already claimed
her boy for God and His war. &#8216;I had from the
first,&#8217; she says, &#8217;definite longings over
Bramwell, and lifted him up to God as soon as I had
strength to do so, especially desiring he should be
a teacher of Holiness.&#8217; These prayers began
to be answered very early. The boy had a truthful and
conscientious nature. Never, his mother says, does
she remember his telling her a lie. But, for all that,
he needed, as do all children, training and teaching,
and Mrs. Booth was too wise not to be firm. She writes
therefore:</p>

<p>&#8217;I believe he will be a thoroughly noble lad,
if I can preserve him from all evil influence. The
Lord help me! I have had to whip him twice lately
severely for disobedience, and it has cost me some
tears. But it has done him good, and I am reaping
the reward already of my self-sacrifice. The Lord
help me to be faithful and firm as a rock in the path
of duty towards my children!&#8217;</p>

<p>We know how practical our Army Mother always was;
sentimental pity without help she despised. When her
little son, therefore, saw and pitied a small boy
with shoeless feet, his mother quickly reminded him
of his little money-box.</p>

<p>&#8217;Would you rather keep the money for barley-sugar,
Willie, or give it to the poor boy?&#8217; she asked.
&#8216;Give it to the boy,&#8217; he said at once,
and so learnt his first lesson in self-denial.</p>

<p>When the boy was seven years old he was converted,
to his mother&#8217;s deepest joy. Some time before
she had talked to him in a Meeting, and urged him
to get saved. The boy sat still and said nothing. &#8217;Willie,
I insist,&#8217; said his mother at last. &#8217;You
must answer me. Will you give your heart to God or
not? Yes or no?&#8217;</p>

<p>Willie looked up in her face steadily and answered
back &#8216;No.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mrs. Booth said no more just then, but held on in
faith and prayer, and some months later, to her unutterable
thankfulness, she found him squeezed in among a number
of other children at the penitent-form. He had, unasked,
made his way there, and was weeping and confessing
his sins with all his heart.</p>

<p>Needless to say, he was faithfully dealt with, and
the boy, now our beloved General, dates his conversion
from that moment. A little later Mrs. Booth wrote
of him:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;Willie has begun to serve God, of course as
a child, but still, I trust, taught of the Spirit.
I feel a great increase of responsibility with respect
to him. Oh! to cherish the tender plant of grace aright.
Lord help!&#8217;</p>

<p>And as with the eldest so with the other seven. One
by one they gave their hearts to the Lord as soon
as they grew old enough to do so.</p>

<p>&#8216;She used to gather us round her,&#8217; says
one of her daughters,&#8217; and pray with us. I wore
then a low frock, and her hot tears would often drop
upon my neck, sending a thrill through me which I
can never forget.&#8217;</p>

<p>She would pray again and again that she might lay
them in their graves rather than she should see them
grow up wicked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Booth was very particular about the way in which
her children were dressed.</p>

<p>Of course, there was no uniform in those days, but
The Army spirit was already in The Army Mother, and
she would not have any finery or show, either for
herself or her children.</p>

<p>&#8216;Accept,&#8217; she writes to her mother, &#8217;my
warm thanks for the little frock you sent. There is
only one difficulty&ndash;it is too smart. We must set an
example in this direction. I feel no temptation now
to decorate myself, but I cannot say the same about
the children; and yet, Oh, I see I must be decided.
Besides, I find it would be dangerous for their own
sakes. The seed of vanity is too deeply sown in their
young hearts for me to dare to cultivate it.&#8217;</p>

<p>Even in her early days Mrs. Booth felt how wrong it
was to spend time and money over dress:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8216;I remember feeling condemned,&#8217; she says,
&#8217;when quite a child, not more than eight years
old, at having to wear a lace tippet such as was fashionable
in those days. From a worldly point of view it would
have been considered, no doubt, very neat and consistent.
But on several occasions I had good crying fits over
it. Not only did I instinctively feel it to be immodest,
because people could see through it, but I thought
it was not such as a Christian child should wear.&#8217;</p>

<p>In everything to do with her home Mrs. Booth was a
most practical and careful mother. She hated waste
and luxury, but her children were always properly
dressed and fed and cared for, and never lacked what
was necessary for them.</p>

<p>Ladies who had been blessed by her words came to consult
her about their souls, and to their surprise found
the great preacher, not shut away in her study, but
hard at work perhaps ironing the baby&#8217;s pinafores,
or cutting out a pair of trousers for one of her boys!
&#8216;I must try,&#8217; she said, when she began
to live this two-fold life, &#8217;to do all in the
kitchen as well as in the pulpit to the glory of God.
The Lord help me.&#8217; He did help her, and it was
this practical mother-spirit at home which gave her
so much force and power on the platform.</p>

<p>As the children grew older, they were more away from
her side, and her letters to them are suitable, not
only to her actual sons and daughters, but to her
spiritual grandchildren who will read this little book.
Therefore I am going to give you some extracts, which
you may take as though written by our Army Mother
straight to your own heart.</p>

<p>To one of her boys at school she wrote:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;I do hope you are industrious, and do not lose
time in play and inattention. Remember Satan steals
his marches on us by <i>littles</i>&ndash;a minute
now, and a minute then. Be on the look out, and don&#8217;t
be cheated by him!</p>

<p>&#8217;All your little trials will soon be over, so
far as school life is concerned; and every one of
them, if borne with patience, will make you a wiser
and better man. Never forget my advice about not listening
to <i>secrets</i>! Don&#8217;t hear anything
that needs to be whispered&ndash;it is sure to be bad.
Choose the boys to be your companions who most love
and fear God, and pray together when you can, and
help each other.&#8217;</p>

<p>Here is a very beautiful letter written when one of
her children desired to go in for some higher education,
which Mrs. Booth feared might spoil the soul life:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;I do so want you and all my children to live
supremely for God. I do so deeply deplore my own failure
compared with what my life might have been, and I
feel as if I could die to save you from making a mistake.
Perhaps you say, &#8220;You don&#8217;t want me, then,
to learn any more?&#8221; Yes, I do, a great deal
more; but of the right kind, in the right way, and
for a right purpose, even the <i>highest good of
your race</i>. I would like you to learn to put
your thoughts together well, to think logically and
clearly, to speak powerfully&ndash;that is, with good but
simple language&ndash;and to write clearly and well.&#8217;</p>

<p>Just the wish we have now for all our Young People!</p>

<p>Early in their childhood the elder children were taught
to be responsible for the younger, and when at school
they were given places of trust as monitors, and so
on. As if knowing the responsibilities they would by
and by be called to fill in our ranks, Mrs. Booth
gives them some wise counsel:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8216;I hope,&#8217; she says to one who has been
left in charge of the other children, &#8217;you will
show yourself to be a true son of your mother, and
a consistent disciple of the Lord. Very much depends
on you as to the ease and comfort of managing the
little ones. Do all you can. Be forbearing where only
your own feelings or comfort are concerned, and don&#8217;t
raise unnecessary difficulties; but where their obedience
to us or their health is at stake, be firm in trying
to put them right.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I am pleased,&#8217; she says to one of the
boys who has been in charge of others at school, &#8217;that
Mr. W. puts such confidence in you; but do not be
puffed up by it. Remember how weak you are, and ask
the Lord to save you from conceit and self-sufficiency.
Try to be fair and just in all dealings with the boys&ndash;i.e.,
do not be hard on a boy whom you may not happen to
like so well as another; but be fair, and treat all
alike when left in charge.&#8217;</p>

<p>Again, she warns one of them against extremes, even
in well doing:</p>

<p>&#8217;You are under a mistake to suppose that sacrificing
your recreation-time will help you in the end. It
will not. Cramming the mind acts just in the same
way as cramming the stomach. It is what you digest
well that benefits you, not what you cram in. So many
hours spent in study, and then relaxation and walking,
will do your mind much more good than &#8220;all work,
and no play.&#8221; Now mark this. Do not be looking
so much at what you <i>have</i> to do as to what
you are <i>doing</i>. Leave the future (you may
spend it in Heaven), and go steadily on doing to-day&#8217;s
work in to-day&#8217;s hours, with recreation in between
to shake the seed in. One step well and firmly taken
is better than two with a slip backwards. Poor human
nature seems as though it must go to extremes&ndash;either
all or none, too much or too little, idleness or being
killed with work! May the Lord show you the happy
medium.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8217;I was sorry about the cause of the accident.
I don&#8217;t like that way of doing things in fun!
Though it was very wrong and wicked of the boy to
throw the brick, yet it would have been better to let
him look at the guinea-pigs being fed, and thus have
pleased him. There was no harm in what he wanted to
do. You should watch against a hectoring spirit, and
mind the difference between a sacrifice of truth and
principle, and one only of self-importance or of mere
feeling. If a boy wants you to do wrong, then be firm
as a rock and brave for God and goodness.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Mind your soul,&#8217; she says at another
time. &#8217;Do not let your thoughts get so absorbed,
even in study, as to lead you to forget your Bible
and to neglect prayer.&#8217;</p>

<p>Later, again, as a wise mother she warns them in the
tenderest way against their special temptations.</p>

<p>Against lightness:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;Be watchful against levity. C. is a good, devoted
fellow, but naturally an incorrigible joker. It may
not hurt him much, because it is his nature; but it
will hurt you if you give way to it. It hurts nearly
everybody.</p>

<p>Watch! Don&#8217;t descend to buffoonery. While you
become all things to win some, don&#8217;t forfeit
your natural self-respect and the dignity of your
position as a servant of Christ.&#8217;</p>

<p>Against too much talk:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;The Spirit is teaching you this&ndash;is showing
you that you must be more silent. The tongue is one
of the greatest enemies to grace (James iii. 5-13).
Strive to obey these teachings of God. Yield yourself
up to obey; and though you sometimes fail and slip,
do not be discouraged, but yield yourself up again
and again, and plead more fervently with God to keep
you. Fourteen years ago you were learning to walk,
and in the process you got many a tumble. But now
you can not only walk yourself, but teach others.
So, spiritually, if you will only let God lead you,
He will perfect that which is lacking in you.&#8217;</p>

<p>But it was not at first easy for the mother-spirit
in Mrs. Booth to allow her delicate girls of fourteen
or fifteen to undertake a public life, and to speak
and sing at the street corners, surrounded by a rough,
low crowd. Such a thing was unheard-of in those days.</p>

<p>Once, hearing that her daughter Catherine had spoken
in the open air to a large crowd, Mrs. Booth objected,
as other mothers have since objected: the girl was
too young as yet&ndash;she must wait awhile.</p>

<p>But her eldest son, looking at his mother in the tenderest
and most solemn way, said, &#8217;Mamma, dear, you
will have to settle this question with God; for Katie
is as surely called and inspired by Him for the particular
work as you are yourself.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mrs. Booth said no more. She took this as the voice
of God, and gave her girl up to the marvellous work
which God had called her to do.</p>

<p>Later she writes of her to a friend:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;Join me in praying that she may be kept humble
and simple, and that all that the Lord has given her
may be used for Him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I see,&#8217; she says, writing at this same
time to her daughter, &#8217;what a glorious, blessed,
useful life you may live; but I also see your danger,
and I pray for you that you may be enabled to cast
aside the world in every form, to look down upon its
opinions, and to despise its spirit, maxims, and fashions.&#8217;</p>

<p>Later on, again, came the days when the boys had to
choose, as you have to do, how they would spend their
lives. Mrs. Booth might be writing to a Corps Cadet
of to-day when, in a letter to one of her sons, she
says:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;I hope the Lord will make you so miserable
everywhere and at everything else that you will be
<i>compelled</i> to preach! Oh, my boy, the Lord
wants such as you&ndash;<i>just such</i>&ndash;to go out
amongst the people, seeking nothing but the things
that are Jesus Christ&#8217;s! You are free to do
it; able by His grace; born to do it, with splendid
opportunities. Will you not rise to your destiny?
&#8220;Have courage, and be strong, and I (the I Am)
will be with thee.&#8221; &#8220;Get thee out, and
I will go with thee.&#8221; Dare you not take hold
of the arm that holds the world and all things up?
And if you do, can you fail? The Lord gird you with
His strength, and make your brow brass, and your tongue
as a flame of fire. You <i>must preach</i>!&#8217;</p>

<p>To another of her boys she writes:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;You may, perhaps, be wanted to stand and do
battle for the Lord. Surely you will not sell your
birthright? The Lord help you! Take hold of David&#8217;s
God. Hold your head up, keep your shoulders back, and
go forward.&#8217;</p>

<p>Again:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;This is what the world wants: men of one idea&ndash;that
of getting people saved. There are plenty of men of
one idea&ndash;that of <i>gold</i>-getting. They make
no secret of it; they are of a worldly spirit. Now
we want men who are set on soul-saving, who are not
ashamed to let everybody know it&ndash;men of a Christ-like
spirit. There need be no mistake or mystery about
it. &#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221;
Paul and every other man of like spirit has had his
fruits, and will have to the end of time. It is &#8220;Not
by might, nor by power, but by <i>My Spirit</i>,
saith the Lord of Hosts."&#8217;</p>

<p>With one of her daughters she reasons and pleads:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;Oh, it seems to me that if I were in your place&ndash;young,
no cares or anxieties, with such a start, such influence,
and such a prospect&ndash;I should not be able to contain
myself for joy! I should, indeed, aspire to be the
&#8220;bride of the Lamb,&#8221; and to follow Him
in conflict for the Salvation of poor, lost, miserable
man. I pray the Lord to show it to you, and so to
enamour you of Himself, that you may see and feel it
to be your chief joy to win them for Him. I say I
pray for this&ndash;yes, I groan for it, with groanings
that cannot be uttered; and if ever you tell me it
is so, I shall be overjoyed.</p>

<p>&#8217;I don&#8217;t want you to make any vows (unless,
indeed, the Spirit leads you to do so); but I want
you to set your mind and heart on winning souls, and
to leave everything else with the Lord. When you do
this you will be happy&ndash;Oh, so happy! Your soul will
then find perfect rest. The Lord grant it to you,
my dear child.&#8217;</p>

<p>She made all her children feel that the only reward
they could give her for her ceaseless toil and labour
on their behalf was that they should give themselves
to the War:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;I hope, my dear boy, that, whatever sense of
obligation or gratitude you have towards me, you will
try to return it by resolutely resisting all temptation
to evil, and by fitting yourself to your utmost to
be useful to your fellow-men. I ask from you, as I
asked from God, no other reward. If I know my own
heart, I would rather that you should work for the
Salvation of souls, making bad hearts good, and miserable
homes happy, and preparing joy and gladness for men
at the Judgment bar, if you only get bread and cheese
all your life, than that you should fill any other
capacity with &#163;10,000 per year.&#8217;</p>

<p>To one of her children, when tempted to be over-anxious,
she writes:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;Keep your mind quiet. Lean back on God, and
don&#8217;t worry. It is His affair, and if you have
done what you could, that is enough. Alas! how little
we have of the faith that can &#8220;stand still, and
see the Salvation of God.&#8221; What would you do
if you were put in custody for two years, like Paul
was? And yet that imprisonment at Rome sent the Gospel
far and wide! God&#8217;s ways are not our ways. He
takes in the whole field at once, and does the best
He can for the entire world. Human wisdom never has
been able at the time to comprehend His plans, but
years after it has often seen their wisdom. Let us
learn to trust in the dark&ndash;to stand still.&#8217;</p>

<p>To another, tried and discouraged at the start of
his public life:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;I have only a minute or two; but, lest you
should think I don&#8217;t sympathize with you, I
send you a line. You ask, did I ever feel so? Yes,
I think just as bad as any mortal <i>could</i>
feel&ndash;<i>empty</i>, inside and out, as though
I had nothing human or Divine to aid me, as if all
Hell were let loose upon me.</p>

<p>But I have generally felt <i>the worse before the
best results</i>, which proves it was Satanic opposition.
And it has been the same with many of God&#8217;s
most honoured instruments. I believe nearly all who
are truly called of God to special usefulness pass
through this buffeting.</p>

<p>&#8217;It stands to sense, if there is a Devil, that
he should desperately withstand those whom he sees
are going to be used of God. Supposing <i>you</i>
were the Devil, and had set your heart on circumventing
God, how would you do it but by opposing those who
were bent on building up His Kingdom? He hopes to
drive us from the field by blood and fire and vapour
of smoke. But our Captain fought and won the battle
for us, and we have only to hold on long enough, and
victory is sure. &#8220;Courage!&#8221; your Captain
cries. &#8220;Only be thou strong, and of good courage,
and I will be with thee, and teach thee what to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8217;"He hath chosen the weak things.&#8221; He
has not <i>made shift with them</i>&ndash;taken them
because there were no others. No! He hath <i>chosen</i>
them. Will He ever forsake them, and thus make Himself
a laughing-stock for Hell? Never! Will He ever let
the Devil say, &#8220;Ah, ah! He chose this weak one,
and then let him fail&#8221;? No, no, no!&#8217;</p>

<p>On the important question of courtship, she writes:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;The Devil sets such innocent-looking traps&ndash;<i>spiritual
traps</i>&ndash;to catch young people! Ah, he is a serpent
still! Beware of his devices, and always cry to God
for wisdom and strength of will to put down all foolish
tampering. You are born for greater things. God may
want you to be a leader in some vast continent, and
you will want a companion and a counsellor&ndash;a &#8220;helpmeet.&#8221;
The original word means &#8220;<i>a help corresponding
to his dignity</i>&#8221; This is the meaning given
by the best expositors. Oh, what wisdom there is even
in the <i>words</i> which God has chosen to express
His ideas! &#8220;Corresponding to his dignity!&#8221;
Yes, and no man ever takes one below this mark who
does not suffer for it; and, worse still, generations
yet unborn have to suffer also. Mind what God says,
and keep yourself till that one comes.</p>

<p>&#8217;A wrong step on this point, and you are undone.
Oh, the misery of an unsuitable match! It is beyond
description. I could tell you tales of woe that are
now being enacted. But I must wait till we meet.</p>

<p>&#8217;I have seen too much of life, and know too
much of human nature, to have much confidence in promises
given under such circumstances. For my own part, I
made up my mind when I was but sixteen that I would
not have a man, though a Christian, who should offer
to become even an abstainer for my sake. I felt that
such a promise would not afford me ground for confidence
afterwards. And do not we see enough all round us to
show that unless people adopt things on principle,
because they see it to be right, they soon change?
Look at the folks who promise to give up tobacco and
dress, for the sake of getting into berths; how soon
it evaporates! No, my lad, wait a bit. &#8220;Couldst
thou not watch with Me one hour?&#8221; Jesus lived
a single life for your sake all the way through. Can
you not live so till He finds you one after His own
heart? I feel sure He will. Pray about it in faith.
I am doing so; and God will answer. But Oh, don&#8217;t
run before Him! Wait on the Lord.</p>

<p>&#8217;A little longer and you will be saying, &#8220;Oh,
how glad I am I waited! I have now found a treasure
indeed!&#8221; When God&#8217;s time and person are
come, He will bring you together. How delighted and
satisfied Isaac must have felt when the servant told
him the way God led him (Genesis xxiv.).&#8217;</p>

<p>When standing by her grave The General said she was
<i>The Army Mother</i>. He said the truth.</p>

<p>One of her early promises, given to her as a girl,
when she only saw its greatness and hid it away in
her heart as too sacred to be spoken of, and almost
too wonderful ever to be accomplished, were the words:
&#8217;I will make thee a mother of nations.&#8217;</p>

<p>When called to send her children abroad, she paid
to the full the heavy price; but she also saw the
glorious outcome, and from her death-bed sent tenderest
messages to those of distant lands and far-off nations
who owned her as their Army Mother.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_07"></a>VII</h1>

<h2>The Worker</h2>

<p>&#8217;What the Lord wants is, that you shall go about
the business to which He sets you, not asking for
an easy post, nor grumbling at a hard one.&#8217;&mdash;<i>Mrs. Booth</i>.</p>

<p>If she had not been a worker, our Army Mother would
have done little with her life. The wonderful call
which came to her, her great gifts, the zeal and love
which filled her heart, would all have been useless
had she not been willing to work, and to work hard,
and to work every day.</p>

<p>Stop and think about this. No life accomplishes anything
unless it is full of hard work&ndash;often work accompanied
by much drudgery, whether it is the life of a king
or of a poor man. Mrs. Booth has set us all an example
in this, for she would work ceaselessly with head or
hands or heart, as long as ever her health allowed
her to do so. Laziness and idleness of all kinds she
detested; nor could she tolerate a lazy person in her
service.</p>

<p>She worked first of all in her home. When she spent
a morning in her kitchen, the work there was perfectly
done. The dinner was ready at the right time, properly
cooked, good and wholesome. She allowed no waste and
no extravagance. Her bread was light and beautifully
baked, and when she had finished her morning&#8217;s
work her kitchen was as neat as when she began. She
finished everything, and put it straight as she went
along.</p>

<p>It was the same with the children. She was alike nurse
and doctor, dressmaker and tailor; she made and mended,
washed and ironed for her boys and girls during their
early years, and herself attended to every smallest
detail of their lives. Strangers who asked where Mrs.
Booth bought her children&#8217;s things, so that
they could go to the same shop, could scarcely believe
the reply: &#8216;Mamma makes all our clothes herself&#8217;&ndash;so beautifully were they cut and finished.</p>

<p>And when the little garments were of no further service
to her, she would alter and mend them once again,
and give them away. Her baby-clothes, when the last
daughter had outgrown them, were given to a member
of the Mission for his child.</p>

<p>He will never forget taking the little bundle home
to his wife and turning over the tiny things. &#8216;I
had often heard Mrs. Booth preach,&#8217; he said,
&#8217;but those baby-clothes preached a louder sermon
to me and my wife than ever her words had done. They
were all darned and mended and patched, and the work&ndash;but,
there, I never saw such stitches! And as we looked,
and knew the hours of toil she must have put into them,
rather than throw them away, as many another would
have done&ndash;well, I tell you I listened to her next
sermon as I had never listened before.&#8217;</p>

<p>And this same diligent, tireless spirit was with her
to the last. When on her deathbed, able only to use
her left hand, and propped up by pillows, she devised
a little frame on which, painfully, stitch by stitch,
she could work a last token of love for The General.</p>

<p>When her hands were folded still in death, I saw those
slippers. They were beautifully embroidered, one with
the words, &#8217;He will keep the feet of His Saints&#8217;;
and the other with the sure and certain hope which
lay beyond the parting, &#8216;Our feet shall stand
within thy gates, O Jerusalem&#8217;&ndash;a fitting and
sacred service with which to close her many years of
toil and labour for others.</p>

<p>But our Army Mother had another way of working in
her home&ndash;that is, she worked over others. If a girl
wished to learn, Mrs. Booth would take endless trouble
in showing her the best way to wash or iron, or clean
a grate, or do whatever the work on hand might be.
She instructed her servants, explaining to them the
reason for doing their duties in a certain way, teaching
them forethought and common sense, and dealing faithfully
with them over all their failures.</p>

<p>&#8216;Better,&#8217; she said, in one of her addresses&ndash;and
she lived it out in her own home&ndash;&#8217;better take
a girl whom you have to teach how to wash a child&#8217;s
face, or to stitch a button on, if she is true and
sincere, than have one ever so clever, who will teach
your children to lie and deceive.&#8217;</p>

<p>She worked, too, over the cases of need and poverty
which were often at her door. Not content, like so
many, with giving a few coppers to a beggar, or some
broken food, she would inquire into the <i>cause</i>
of the distress; and then, if the need seemed genuine,
she would help, either by getting the father work,
or by having the home visited and suitable relief
given after the true condition of things had been found
out.</p>

<p>And this was only a little of the homework with which
her hands were ever full. Of her ceaseless care over
her children&#8217;s mind and soul training I have
told you elsewhere. But of her public work perhaps
the most exhausting was that which resulted from her
Meetings. For she could not rest content with the
most careful preparation beforehand, nor with pouring
out her whole soul upon the people during the forty
or fifty minutes that her address lasted. At the close
of the Meeting, whenever her health allowed it, she
would labour and toil, often for two hours and more,
dealing herself with the penitents, meeting their difficulties,
one by one, and was unwilling to leave them until,
as far as possible, all had claimed and received the
blessing they sought.</p>

<p>The next day, too, she would follow up any special
case with a long personal letter from her own pen,
or she would arrange another interview, or in some
way keep in close, actual touch with the struggling
soul, until the step of obedience had been taken,
and he or she was fairly started on the Narrow Way.</p>

<p>And it was this careful, earnest, patient after-work
which gave such glorious harvests to her soul-saving
campaigns. Labour and trouble were a joy to her, if
she could but help one sincere, seeking soul into the
light.</p>

<p>But remember this: while she so toiled over all who
came to her for advice and guidance, she never repeated
nor passed on to others their confidences. If she
had done so, people would soon have left off corning
to her; they would have said, &#8216;We cannot trust
her.&#8217; She was, as you know, a mighty speaker;
but about other people&#8217;s affairs she was entirely
silent&ndash;as you must learn to be if you wish to be of
any service to God or man.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Booth strove constantly to teach all who
were around her to work as she did. &#8216;You have
begun well enough&ndash;now carry it through,&#8217; she
would say again and again to her children, and whether
it was a doll&#8217;s frock, or an article for &#8216;The
War Cry,&#8217; or a series of Meetings, it was always
the same. Unfinished, half-done work she detested with
all her soul. &#8217;If a thing is worth beginning
at all, then it is worth finishing,&#8217; she would
say; and this great principle followed her through
her life in small things as in great.</p>

<p>This was the reason that, on her deathbed, she could
say, turning to the Chief of the Staff, &#8217;I have
no vain regrets about the past. As far as my strength
allowed, I have finished the work I had to do as I
went along; and now I leave it, all imperfect as it
has been, in His hands.&#8217;</p>

<p>Perhaps, by nature, you are not a worker. But what
you are not by nature, you can become by grace. God
can teach you to love work. And as you work, you will,
like our dear Army Mother, learn better and better
how to work; and your life, whenever God calls you
to lay it down, shall be like hers, not unfinished,
but complete.</p>

<h2>Goodness</h2>

<p>&#8217;I see more than ever that the religion which
is pleasing to God consists in doing and enduring
His will, rather than in good sentiments and feelings.
The Lord help us to endure as seeing Him who is invisible.&#8217;&mdash;<i>Mrs. Booth</i>.</p>

<p>When our first General stood on that October evening
by the grave of his beloved wife, and spoke to us
with a breaking heart of our Army Mother, he unfolded
to us the three great qualities which made her character
so beautiful. First, and foremost, she was good; secondly,
she was love; and, thirdly, she was a Warrior. Let
us, following The General&#8217;s outline, look at
these three leading qualities in her life. &#8216;First,&#8217;
he said, &#8217;she was <i>good</i>. She was
washed in the Blood of the Lamb. To the last moment
her cry was &#8220;a sinner saved by grace.&#8221;
She was a thorough hater of shams, hypocrisies, and
make-believes. Her goodness was of a practical sort.
&#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them&#8221; was
a text she often quoted, and one by which she was
always willing to be judged.&#8217;</p>

<p>It is of this &#8216;goodness of a practical sort&#8217;
that I want first to tell you, before we consider
that soul goodness which made her life so holy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Booth could not imagine any goodness apart from
industry. As we have already seen, she considered
it a sin to waste precious time. Any one who was lazy
she could not endure, and when one such offered for
the work she wrote of him:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;I do hope you will not throw a lot of money away in trying H&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;, just
for want of courage to tell him at once that he will not do, because I am
sure that it will be thrown away. It is the <i>nature</i> of the man that
is at fault, and not his <i>circumstances</i>. He is a <i>drone</i>, and
nothing, no change of place or position, can ever make him into a bee. He
never ought to have left his trade; he never <i>would</i> have done so if
he had thought soul-saving was harder work!&#8217;</p>

<p>Extravagance and waste of every kind she abhorred,
and had she not been so careful in planning and arranging,
her time and money would again and again have run
short. The sewing, mending, and housekeeping needed
for a family of little children when means are scarce
would have been burden enough for most mothers. But
besides this came her own letter-writing, preparing
for her Meetings, and also the hours she spent consulting
and advising The General, whose voice, &#8216;Here,
Kate,&#8217; would call her from the nursery or kitchen
to help him decide some important question.</p>

<p>Again, it was impossible to talk to Mrs. Booth, even
for five minutes, without finding how true and sincere
she was. To please no one would she keep back the
truth, or appear different from her real self.</p>

<p>&#8216;I believe,&#8217; she writes, when quite a
young woman, &#8217;honesty to be the best policy,
and I shall act upon it. Let me have truth, if it shakes
the foundation of the earth.&#8217;</p>

<p>She was sincere and faithful in every part of her
nature: faithful with her own soul and in dealing
with the souls of others. Great or small, rich or
poor, she made no difference, and never held back from
reproving sin when it was needful.</p>

<p>&#8216;I see more than ever,&#8217; she said, &#8217;the
need of making righteous people true in their <i>inward
parts</i>. Let us be more thorough than ever with
souls under conviction. Let us not be afraid to wound
too deeply. Thousands of professors have never been
truly convinced of sin, much less truly converted.
Sin to them is <i>being found out</i>!&#8217;</p>

<p>Though all through her life our Army Mother hungered
and thirsted to know God better, and to serve Him
more perfectly, yet it was not till some time after
her marriage that she received the blessing of a clean
heart.</p>

<p>Of the struggle and conflict which she went through,
before the blessing of Holiness became hers, she shall
tell you in her own words:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;I had been earnestly seeking all the week to
know Jesus as an all-sufficient Saviour dwelling
in my heart, and thus cleansing it every moment of
all sin; but on Thursday and Friday I laid aside almost
everything else, and spent the chief part of the day
in reading and prayer, and trying to believe for it.
On Thursday afternoon at tea-time I was well-nigh
discouraged, and felt my old visitant, irritability,
and the Devil told me I should never get it, and so
I might as well give it up at once. However, I know
him of old as a liar and the father of lies, and pressed
on, cast down, yet not destroyed.</p>

<p>&#8217;On Friday morning God gave me two precious
passages. First, &#8220;Come unto Me all ye that labour
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&#8221;
Oh, how sweet it sounded to my poor, weary, sin-stricken
soul! I almost dared to believe that He did give me
rest from inbred sin&ndash;the rest of perfect Holiness.
But I staggered at the promise through unbelief, and
therefore failed to enter in. The second passage consisted
of those thrice-blessed words, &#8220;Of Him are ye
in Christ Jesus, who is made unto us wisdom, righteousness,
sanctification, and redemption.&#8221; But again unbelief
hindered me, although I felt as if getting gradually
nearer.</p>

<p>&#8217;I struggled through the day until a little
after six in the evening, when William joined me in
prayer. We had a blessed season. While he was saying,
&#8220;Lord, we open our hearts to receive Thee,&#8221;
that word was spoken to my soul, &#8220;Behold, I
stand at the door and knock. If any man hear My voice,
and open unto Me, I will come in, and sup with him.&#8221;
I felt sure He had long been knocking, and Oh, how
I yearned to receive Him as a perfect Saviour! But
Oh, the inveterate habit of unbelief! How wonderful
that God should have borne so long with me! When we
got up from our knees, I lay on the sofa, exhausted
with the excitement and effort of the day. William
said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you lay all on the altar?&#8221;
I replied, &#8220;I am sure I do!&#8221; Then he said,
&#8220;And isn&#8217;t the altar holy?&#8221; I replied
in the language of the Holy Ghost, &#8220;The altar
is most holy, and whatsoever toucheth it is holy.&#8221;
Then, said he, &#8220;Are you not holy?&#8221; I replied
with my heart full of emotion and with some faith,
&#8220;Oh, I think I am!&#8221; Immediately the word
was given me to confirm my faith. &#8220;Now are ye
clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.&#8221;
And I took hold&ndash;true, with a trembling hand, and
not unmolested by the tempter, but I held fast the
beginning of my confidence, and it grew stronger, and
from that moment I have dared to reckon myself dead
indeed unto sin, and alive unto God through Jesus
Christ my Lord.</p>

<p>&#8217;I did not feel much rapturous joy, but perfect
peace, the sweet rest which Jesus promised to the
heavy laden. I have understood the Apostle&#8217;s
meaning when he says, &#8220;We who believe do enter
into rest.&#8221; This is just descriptive of my state
at present. Not that I am not tempted, but I am allowed
to know the Devil when he approaches me, and I look
to my Deliverer Jesus, and He still gives me rest.
Two or three very trying things occurred on Saturday,
which at another time would have excited impatience,
but I was kept by the power of God through faith unto
full Salvation.</p>

<p>&#8217;And now what shall I say? &#8220;Unto Him who
has washed me in His own Blood be glory and dominion
for ever and ever,&#8221; and all within me says &#8220;Amen!&#8221;
Oh! I cannot describe, I have no words to set forth
the sense I have of my own utter unworthiness. Satan
has met me frequently with my peculiarly aggravated
sins, and I have admitted it all. But then I have said,
the Lord has not made my sanctification to depend
in any measure on my own worthiness or unworthiness,
but on the worthiness of my Saviour. He came to seek
and to save &#8220;that which was lost.&#8221; &#8220;Where
sin hath abounded, grace doth much more abound"&#8217;</p>

<p>How wonderfully in after years Mrs. Booth explained
and led others into this same blessing, we know. Was
not, then, the long struggle and agony on her own
behalf worth it? Yes, indeed, and it will be so with
you when you get this glorious blessing in your soul.</p>

<p>You will have noticed how in struggling for Holiness
Mrs. Booth had to fight unbelief. This determination
to trust God fully marked her out as strong in faith.</p>

<p>She had this marvellous faith because she obeyed and
struggled to throw herself on the Lord; but faith
was not <i>natural</i> to her any more than it
is to you or me.</p>

<p>Often money was short, and she hardly knew how she
would be able to feed and clothe her family: this
was a sore trial of her faith. On one such occasion
she wrote to her mother:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;We have not at present received as much as
our travelling expenses and house rent. I feel a good
deal perplexed, and am sometimes tempted to mistrust
the Lord. But I will not allow it. Our Father knows!&#8217;</p>

<p>Later on we get a sight of her own experience in one
of her letters, when she said:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;I am much tried just now by perplexities of
every kind; uncertainty, from a human standpoint,
hedges me in on every side. Satan says it is useless
trying to steer straight through such a labyrinth;
but I am determined to hold on to the promises, come
what will. My God is the living God. He sees me, knows
me, loves me, cares for me, wants to have me with
Him in Glory, as much as He did Abraham, or Paul, or
John. If this be true, what have I to fear?&#8217;</p>

<p>And again:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;"Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldst
believe, thou shouldst see the Salvation of God?&#8221;
This is a precious word. It has kept my soul alive
many a time when Satan has almost overthrown me. &#8220;If
thou canst believe, all things are possible to thee.
Never mind whether anybody else can or cannot. If
others are too strong to let Me carry them, if thou
art weak enough to throw up all self-effort, and trust
Me with thy whole weight, I will carry thee, and thou
shalt glorify Me.&#8221; I know this is the way. Hence
the babes go in with the simple and the great sinners,
while the reasoners, and the strong, and the proud,
and the fearful are shut out.&#8217;</p>

<p>Again, to one who was cast down, and tempted to be
discouraged because of his failings, she writes:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;It is well to see them, for how can we take
hold of Jesus to mend what we don&#8217;t see? It
is best to know ourselves, but we Salvationists are
in danger of erring on the other side. We look too
much at ourselves apart from Him who is or would be
our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.
Faith in Him as your keeper will do more in five minutes
than years of conflict without it.&#8217;</p>

<p>Once, in another letter, she gives us a beautiful
bit of her own soul&#8217;s experience on this subject:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;I had such a view of His love and faithfulness
on the journey from Wellingborough, that I thought
I would never doubt again about anything. I had the
carriage to myself, and such a precious season with
the Lord, that the time seemed to fly. As the lightning
gleamed around I felt ready to shout, &#8220;The chariot
of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.&#8221; Oh, how
precious it is when we see as well as believe, but
yet more blessed to believe and not see! Lord, work
this determined, obstinate, blind, unquestioning,
unanswering faith in me and my beloved friend, and
let us two dare to trust Thee in the midst of our
peculiar trials. As I looked at the waving fields,
and grazing sheep, the flashing sky, a Voice said
in my soul, &#8220;Of what oughtest thou to be afraid?
Am I not God? Cannot I supply thy little, tiny needs?&#8221;
My heart replied, &#8220;It is enough, Lord; I will
trust Thee, forgive my unbelief."&#8217;</p>

<h1><a name="ch_09"></a>IX</h1>

<h2>Love</h2>

<p>The truest love must ever seek the highest good of
its object; sometimes even with forgetfulness of important
smaller advantages.&#8217;&mdash;<i>Mrs. Booth</i>.</p>

<p>The second great quality in Mrs. Booth&#8217;s character,
as given by the first General, was her love.</p>

<p>&#8216;She was <i>love</i>,&#8217; he says. &#8217;Her
whole soul was full of tender, deep compassion. Oh,
how she loved, how she pitied the suffering poor! How
she longed to put her arms round the sorrowful, and
help them!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How,&#8217; asked Mrs. Booth once, &#8217;are
we to put heart into people? Even grace seems to fail
to do so in many instances. I think it needs mothers
to do this from infancy upwards.&#8217;</p>

<p>You will recollect that Mrs. Mumford fostered this
&#8216;heart&#8217; and love in her little girl; and
you will remember how keenly Katie felt, blazing up
into wrath at any story of wrong or injury, and ready
to sacrifice her life for those she loved. This spirit
grew with her. She could not help caring and struggling
to help all who needed her. The General often told
her in later years that she was killing herself by
carrying every one&#8217;s burdens. Then she would
try to leave off for a little, but her heart was too
strong, and she could not hold it back.</p>

<p>When but a child, running down the road with her hoop
and stick, she saw a drunkard being dragged off to
prison by a policeman. All the people were jeering
and mocking at the poor friendless wretch. Instantly
Katie&#8217;s pity and love fired up. She dashed across
the street, and marched along close by the man&#8217;s
side, so that he might feel that at least one little
heart cared for him, and wanted to help him.</p>

<p>To the end of her life she carried this deep, tender
pity wherever she went. She loved the poor. &#8216;With
all their faults,&#8217; she said, &#8217;they have
larger hearts than the rich&#8217;; and she loved them
for it.</p>

<p>Where any one had a warm heart, she could forgive
and overlook many mistakes; but with cold, narrow,
&#8216;fishy&#8217; souls, she had neither sympathy
nor patience.</p>

<p>Our Army Mother&#8217;s help was practical. She did
not only give money or pity, but she&ndash;so to speak&ndash;rolled
up her sleeves and helped the suffering herself.</p>

<p>Every sort of suffering and need appealed to her.
If an animal was wounded or in pain, she stopped,
and herself relieved it as best she could; and to
the last, if she saw a horse or any creature being
ill-treated, she would not hesitate to rush out and
stop the driver, or in some way force him to leave
off his cruelty.</p>

<p>She was not only kind and helpful to those she liked,
but every living thing that suffered had a claim upon
her, and the greater the need the more tender and
ready was her help.</p>

<p>Mrs. Booth was a people&#8217;s woman, and she was
never weary of scheming and planning how to help the
poor in the most practical way.</p>

<p>&#8216;When I see people going wrong,&#8217; she said,
when but a girl of twelve, &#8217;I must tell the
poor things how to manage.&#8217;</p>

<p>Dirt and sin, and drink and misery, could not quench
this love; it was a part of her very nature. Long,
long before Slum Sisters were ever thought of, Mrs.
Booth did their work herself, just because she so loved
the poor, and longed to help them. You shall read
the story in her own words:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;I remember in one case finding a poor woman
lying on a heap of rags. She had just given birth
to twins, and there was nobody of any sort to wait
upon her. I can never forget the desolation of that
room. By her side was a crust of bread and a small
lump of lard. &#8220;I fancied a bit o&#8217; bootter
(butter),&#8221; the woman remarked apologetically,
noticing my eye fall upon the scanty meal, &#8220;and
my mon, he&#8217;d do owt for me he could, bless&#8217;m&ndash;he
couldna git me iny bootter, so he fitcht me this bit
o&#8217; lard. Have <i>you</i> iver tried lard
isted o&#8217; bootter? It&#8217;s <i>rare good</i>!&#8221;
said the poor creature, making me wish I had taken
lard for &#8220;bootter&#8221; all my life, that I
might have been the better able to minister to her
needs. However, I was soon busy trying to make her
a little more comfortable. The babies I washed in
a broken pie-dish, the nearest approach to a tub that
I could find. And the gratitude of those large eyes,
that gazed upon me from out of that wan and shrunken
face, can never fade from my memory.&#8217;</p>

<p>Before public Meetings took up so much of her time,
she delighted in this house-to-house visiting, and
went especially for the drunkards, over whom God gave
her a wonderful power.</p>

<p>&#8216;I used to visit in the evenings,&#8217; she
says, &#8217;because it was the only part of the day
in which I could get away; and, besides, I should not
have found the men at home at any other time. I used
to ask one drunkard&#8217;s wife where another lived.
They always knew. After getting hold of eight or ten
in this way, and getting them to sign the pledge, I
used to arrange Cottage Meetings for them, and try
to get them saved. They used to let me talk to them
in homes where there was not a stick of furniture,
and nothing to sit down upon.&#8217;</p>

<p>In this way our Army Mother sought and cared for the
drunkards long before Drunkards&#8217; Brigades were
dreamt of.</p>

<p>When, at a later time in her life, she first heard
of the wicked and cruel way in which young girls are
trapped and drawn into sin, Mrs. Booth&#8217;s soul
was filled with a whirlwind of holy indignation.</p>

<p>&#8217;I feel as though I could not rest, but as though
I must go and ferret out these monsters myself,&#8217;
she wrote. &#8217;Almost everybody, notwithstanding
the indignation, seems so content with talking. Nobody
appears willing to take the responsibility of doing
or risking anything. Oh, what a state the world has
got into!&#8217;</p>

<p>But, deep and practical as was her love in earthly
things, her passion for lifting and leading souls
into Salvation and Holiness was a thousand times more
intense. &#8217;If we only realized, as we ought, the
value of souls, we should not live long under it,&#8217;
she said; and she herself realized it fully enough
to make her fight on ceaselessly in spite of intense
weakness. &#8216;If it were not for eternity,&#8217;
she often sighed, &#8217;I should soon give up this
life.&#8217;</p>

<p>It was love for souls which made her go from town
to town, care-worn, weary, often quite unfit to meet
the immense congregations which came to hear her.</p>

<p>It was love for souls which kept her sitting for hours
at her writing-table, when she should have been resting,
trying to help those who turned to her for counsel
and direction from every part of the globe.</p>

<p>It was love for souls which gave her many a sleepless
night, and chained her to her knees, weeping and pleading,
agonizing with God on behalf of the people she was
to face the next day.</p>

<p>And this love for souls grew even stronger as death
came near. &#8216;Eva,&#8217; she exclaimed to one
of her daughters, as she lay racked with agonizing
pain, &#8217;don&#8217;t you forget that man with
the handcuffs on. Find him. Go to Lancaster Jail;
let somebody go with you, and find that man. Tell him
that your mother, when she was dying, prayed for him,
and that she had a feeling in her heart that God would
save him; and tell him, hard as the ten years of imprisonment
may be, it will be easier with Christ than it would
be without Him.&#8217;</p>

<p>She was lying between earth and Heaven, thinking of
the joy and peace awaiting her, when it seemed as
if she saw the dark face of a heathen woman, and heard
the cry, &#8216;Won&#8217;t you help us?&#8217; The
old love for perishing souls woke again directly,
and she cried, &#8217;Oh, yes, Lord, I will go anywhere
to help poor struggling people. I would go on an errand
to Hell, if the Lord would promise me that the Devil
should not keep me there.&#8217;</p>

<p>In one of these last days she sent a dying message
to the Officers. &#8217;Tell them,&#8217; she said,
&#8217;that the only consolation for a Salvationist
on his death-bed is to have been a soul-winner. After
all my labours I feel I have come far short of the
prize of my high calling. Beseech them to redeem their
time, for we can do but little at the best.&#8217;</p>

<p>A little maid who was a Candidate came into Mrs. Booth&#8217;s
sick-room once as she was speaking, and she called
her to her bedside, giving her warning and counsel
which every Corps Cadet can take as though spoken to
herself:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8216;You will be finished with the dishes soon,&#8217;
she said, &#8217;and you are going to be a Cadet.
I have been very pleased with you while you have been
here, because you have worked out of sight with a good
will, and I think you will make a brave Officer. You
will promise me, will you?&#8217; she said, as she
laid her trembling hand on the girl&#8217;s head. &#8216;Yes,&#8217;
was the reply, &#8216;I will,&#8217; amid stifled
sobs.</p>

<p>&#8216;Give me a kiss, then,&#8217; said Mrs. Booth.
&#8217;Promise me that you will never get spoiled
by any unfaithful Officer. If you ever get mixed up
with such, do not hide it from Headquarters, but let
them know about it, and they will soon move the false
away from you. I shan&#8217;t be here; but, Oh! may
God help them to get rid of the wrong. Discernment
of spirits! Oh, why should we not have that gift back?
It is very necessary.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mrs. Booth&#8217;s whole heart was wrapped up in the
spread of The Army, and she was never more of a warrior
than when fighting its battles. And The Army needed
some one to stand up for it in those days. We who live
to-day can hardly fancy the fierce, bitter persecution
the early-day Salvationists had to fight through.</p>

<p>Now, even those who dislike and despise us are forced
to admit that &#8217;The Army does a great deal of
good&#8217;; but then it was different, and again and
again, both by speech and writing, Mrs. Booth had to
defend and stand up for our methods.</p>

<p>&#8216;I would not,&#8217; she says, after she had
spoken too plainly for some rich people who were offended
at her words, &#8217;sit down and listen to their
abuse of The Salvation Army for all their money. But
I did not say a word that I would object to have published
upon the housetops. Such, however, is often the spirit
of the rich. They think that one must sit and hear
whatever they may choose to say, and hold one&#8217;s
breath, because of their money! But, no, I will never
be dumb before a golden idol!&#8217;</p>

<p>She loved the Uniform: she herself planned that worn
by Army women, and always wore her own, rejoicing
to be able to give to our people a way of escape from
the fashions and extravagances of the world.</p>

<p>She loved the Flag, and was true to its beautiful
meaning. She loved to present Colours to the newly-opened
Corps, or to parties of Officers going abroad; and
when, shortly before she passed away, she changed her
room, she begged that the dear Army Flag might be brought
in and hung above her bed.</p>

<p>&#8216;There,&#8217; said The General, &#8216;the
Colours are over you now, my darling.&#8217;</p>

<p>And she clasped them fondly with her left hand, and
traced the motto&ndash;&#8216;Blood and Fire.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; she said, &#8217;Blood and Fire;
that is just what my life has been&ndash;a constant and
severe fight.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It ought to be &#8220;Blood and Fire and Victory,"&#8217;
said The General.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll fight on till I get it,&#8217; she
answered. &#8217;I won&#8217;t give in. Next time
I see them I shall be above the pain and sorrow for
ever.&#8217;</p>

<p>But, though at the last she longed to be at rest,
it was not easy for her great mother&#8217;s heart
to unloose itself from those she loved, and from the
thousands in all lands who looked to her as to a mother.</p>

<p>If you have learnt to love very deeply you will also
have to suffer, and her very love made the parting
so difficult.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh,&#8217; she exclaimed, when speaking of
leaving The General and her children, &#8217;mine
is such a heart! it seems as if it had got roots all
round the world clutching on to one and another, and
that it will not let them go! And yet You can take
care of them, Lord, better than I could. I do, I do
believe! O Eternal Father, Shepherd of the sheep, do
Thou look after my little flock!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Amen,&#8217; we who read these lines may say;
adding to her prayer, &#8217;And give us that same
heart and love which made her life of such mighty power.&#8217;</p>

<h2>The Warrior</h2>

<p>&#8217;Fighting is hard work, whatever sort of fighting
it is. You cannot fight without wounds of body, heart,
or soul.&#8217;&mdash;<i>Mrs. Booth</i>.</p>

<p>&#8216;Lastly,&#8217; said The General in that same
beautiful tribute to our Army Mother that I have already
quoted from,&#8217; she was a <i>warrior</i>.
She liked the fight. She was not one who said to others,
&#8220;Go,&#8221; but &#8220;Here, let <i>me</i>
go&#8221;; and when there was the necessity she said,
&#8220;I <i>will</i> go!&#8221; I never knew
her flinch until her poor body compelled her to lie
on one side.&#8217;</p>

<p>Our Army Mother was, indeed, before all things a warrior;
she fought bravely and unceasingly her whole life
through.</p>

<p>In thought and purpose she was independent, and dared
to stand out for what she felt right. Cowardice, in
her opinion, was one of the commonest and most subtle
sins of the day, and she had no patience with those
who dared not say &#8216;No,&#8217; and feared to
stand alone.</p>

<p>She thought for herself, and though always eager to
hear and learn as much as possible from others, yet
she was not carried away by their opinions, but carefully
weighed and considered their arguments, and then formed
her own judgments.</p>

<p>Mrs. Booth strove earnestly for doctrine.</p>

<p>&#8216;Let us take care,&#8217; she said, in The Army&#8217;s
early days, &#8217;what Gospel we preach. Let us mind
our doctrine.&#8217;</p>

<p>And again:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;We must stick to the form of sound words, for
there is more in it than appears on the surface. &#8220;Glory
be to the Father, to the Son, and the Holy Ghost,&#8221;
was the theology of our forefathers, and I am suspicious
of all attempts to mend it.&#8217;</p>

<p>And once more:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;Let us beware of wrong doctrine, come through
whomsoever it may. Holy men make sad mistakes. &#8220;Well,
but,&#8221; say some, &#8220;is not a person who holds
wrong views with a right heart better than a person
with right views and a wrong heart?&#8221; Yes, so
far as his personal state before God is concerned,
but not in his influence on man. My charity must extend
to those likely to be deceived or ruined by his doctrines
as well as to him.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mrs. Booth&#8217;s whole life was a continual fight
against sin&ndash;sin of all kinds. Whether her Meeting
was held for the very lowest and roughest, or whether
rows of clergy and lawyers, and lords and ladies sat
to listen, it made no difference to her. She attacked
sin, and went straight at the very heart-sins of the
people in front of her.</p>

<p>&#8216;We need great grace,&#8217; she says in the
midst of her wonderful West-End campaign, where even
princes and princesses came to hear her. &#8217;I think
the Lord never enabled me to be more plain and faithful.
As a lady in high circles said to me, &#8220;We never
heard this sort of Gospel before.&#8221; No, poor
things, they are sadly deceived.&#8217;</p>

<p>Drink, too, was another evil which Mrs. Booth fought
against during the whole of her life. She began, as
you remember, when a girl by being secretary of the
&#8216;Band of Love&#8217; of those days.</p>

<p>In the early days of their engagement The General
was strongly advised to take a little wine for the
sake of his health. Our Army Mother wrote him a long
letter, showing him how false and foolish such advice
was, and ending with:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;I have had it recommended to me scores of times,
but I am fully and for ever settled on the physical
side of the question. [Footnote: That means taking
it for the sake of health.&ndash;<i>Ed</i>.]</p>

<p>&#8217;It is a subject on which I am most anxious
you should be thorough. I have far more hope for your
health <i>because</i> you abstain, than I should
if you took wine. Flee the detestable thing as you
would a serpent; be a teetotaller in principle and
practice.&#8217;</p>

<p>Though, as we have seen, full of boundless faith and
pity for the drunkard, Mrs. Booth attacked the makers
and sellers of drink unmercifully. She says, on one
occasion:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;By your peace of conscience on a dying bed;
by the eternal destinies of your children, by your
care for never-dying souls; by the love you owe your
Saviour, I beseech you <i>banish the drink</i>.</p>

<p>&#8217;Tell me no more of charity towards brewers,
distillers, and publicans. Your false charity to these
has already consigned millions to an untimely Hell!...
Arise, Christians, arise, and fight this foe! You and
you alone are able, for your God will fight for you!&#8217;</p>

<p>Another thing for which our Army Mother fought, and
which to-day we owe in great measure to her efforts,
is the position to which women have been lifted as
speakers and teachers in God&#8217;s work. She first,
as we have seen, opened the way herself; and then
she left it open, encouraging and helping tens of
thousands of simple, holy women all round the world
to follow in her steps.</p>

<p>She had a tough battle to wage. All classes wrote
and spoke against women being allowed to stand and
speak for God in the open air or in public halls;
but, strong in faith and courage, convinced that she
had Divine authority for what she did, our Army Mother
fought on, arguing, writing, preaching on the matter.
Now to-day there is scarcely a land where The Army
bonnet is not known and loved, nor where Army women
cannot gain a crowd of respectful listeners.</p>

<p>Now I am going to show you some of the hindrances
in spite of which our Army Mother fought on.</p>

<p>The first of these hindrances was the burden which
God allowed Mrs. Booth to carry all through her life&ndash;a
weak and suffering body. She said, when her life was
drawing to its close, that suffering seemed to have
been her special lot, and that she could scarcely
remember a day in her life when she had been wholly
free from pain.</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t care about my body,&#8217; she
exclaimed when lying in her last illness. &#8217;It
has been a poor old troublesome affair. I shall be
glad for it to be sealed up. It is time it was. Oh,
I have dragged it wearily about.&#8217;</p>

<p>Most women suffering as she did, with a weak spine,
heart disease, and over-strained nerves, would have
lived the life of an invalid. But the warrior spirit
within forced her body along. Scores of times she has
gone from her bed to the Meeting, and then, exhausted
and fainting with the effort, has had to be almost
carried home. But she had done her work, and sent
the arrow of conviction into hundreds of hearts.</p>

<p>Writing after one special strain of work and anxiety,
she says:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;The excitement made me worse than I have been
for two years. My heart was really alarming, and for
two days I could hardly bear any clothes to touch
me. This has disheartened me again as to my condition.
But God reigns, and He will keep me alive as long
as He needs me.&#8217;</p>

<p>Another of her hindrances, and one which was almost
more difficult to overcome than weakness of body,
was depression.</p>

<p>I wonder if you know what that is? If so, it will
help you to realize that Mrs. Booth had to fight it
also.</p>

<p>The Devil seemed allowed to try and test her faith
to the uttermost, and at times to blot out all peace
and glory from her soul. During one such time of darkness
she writes:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;I know I ought not, of all saints, or sinners
either, to be depressed. I know it dishonours my Lord,
grieves His Spirit, and injures me greatly; and I
would fain hide from everybody to prevent their seeing
it. But I cannot help it. I have struggled hard, more
than any one knows, for a long time against it. Sometimes
I have literally held myself, head and heart and hand,
and waited for the floods to pass over me.&#8217;</p>

<p>But our Army Mother did not give up working for God,
and sit down in despair, because she was thus tried.
One day, just before leaving for a great West-End
Meeting, in which God made her words as a sharp two-edged
sword, she wrote this to one of her children:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;I have been very much depressed since you left&ndash;more
so than usual. It is of no use reasoning with myself
when these fits of despondency are on me. I must hold
on and fight my passage through; and when I get to
Heaven the light and joy will be all the greater.
If I dared give up working I should do so a hundred
times over; but I <i>dare</i> not.&#8217;</p>

<p>Another and constant hindrance which our Army Mother
had to fight for the greater part of her life was
poverty. It was so difficult, many times, to make
two ends meet. She had, during many years of her life,
no regular money coming in on which to depend, and
during that time it was a constant struggle to have
her children properly cared for and give them the
needed education.</p>

<p>But most of all did our Army Mother show herself a
warrior in her own Salvation campaigns. In those early
days there were no praying Soldiers and Sergeants
to be had to deal with the penitents&ndash;no one, either,
to lead her singing, scarcely even to keep the doors
or take up the collection. She would arrive in a town
absolutely alone. A hall had been taken in which she
was to speak, and she would hire a tiny lodging, or
stay in whatever home would receive her, and set to
work. We can scarcely understand the loneliness of
her position. Here was a proof of her mighty faith
in God.</p>

<p>She began these solitary campaigns when her sixth
child was but a few weeks old, and God most wonderfully
owned her labours. At one place she saw one hundred
grown-up people and two hundred children come to her
penitent-form in six days. But it was a fearful battle.</p>

<p>&#8216;I have a comfortable little cot to stay in,&#8217;
she writes to her mother from one such battle-field,
&#8217;very small and humble; but it is clean and
quiet; and when I feel nervous no one knows the value
of quietness. I have felt it hard work lately. Many
a time have I longed to be where the weary are at
rest.&#8217;</p>

<p>At Margate, some years later, she commenced her Meetings
without knowing a single person in the place. For
some weeks she had not even a helper in the Prayer
Meetings, nor one who would give out a song for her.
Mrs. Booth could not sing herself, and there was often
an awkward pause before any one would be willing to
pitch her tune. &#8216;If only,&#8217; she said when
The Army was fairly on its feet, &#8217;I had been
able to command a dozen reliable people such as I
could have anywhere now, I think I could have done
almost anything.&#8217;</p>

<p>Even more wonderful was her experience at Brighton.</p>

<p>The Dome, a great building holding three thousand
people, had been taken for her Meetings.</p>

<p>&#8216;I can never forget my feelings,&#8217; says
this Soldier-saint, &#8217;as I stood upon the platform
and looked upon the people, realizing that among them
all there was no one to help me. When I commenced the
Prayer Meeting, for which I should think quite nine
hundred remained, Satan said to me, as I came down
from the platform according to my custom, &#8220;You
will never ask such people as these to come and kneel
down here? You will only make a fool of yourself if
you do.&#8221; I felt stunned for a moment; but I answered,
&#8220;Yes, I shall. I shall not make it any easier
for them than for the others. If they do not realize
their sins enough to be willing to come and kneel
here, they will not be of much use to the kingdom."&#8217;</p>

<p>The Lord set His seal upon Mrs. Booth&#8217;s faith
and courage, for the first to volunteer were two old
gentlemen, both over seventy years of age; and she
had ten or twelve at the mercy-seat before the Meeting
ended.</p>

<p>Writing from Portsmouth, she tells the same story
of loneliness and victory:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;You say, &#8220;How do you get on personally?&#8221;
Oh, I never was so hampered for help in every way
in all my life! The most able man I have keeps a milliner&#8217;s
shop, and the one that opens for me generally is an
overseer; so their attention is divided and the time
limited. Pray for me. I never needed your prayers
so much. This is a dreadfully wicked place.&#8217;</p>

<p>Yet during the seventeen weeks of her stay some six
hundred names were taken, many of them wonderful trophies
of God&#8217;s mercy.</p>

<p>Having lived such a warrior&#8217;s life, you think,
very likely, that the death-bed experience of our
Army Mother would be all peace and glory. But no.
Right down into the Valley she needed to use the Sword
of the Spirit and the Shield of Faith, for to the
last Satan was allowed to test and try her.</p>

<p>But she fought on!</p>

<p>&#8216;One of my hardest lessons,&#8217; she said
in her last hours, &#8217;has been the difference
between faith and realization; and if I have had to
conquer all through life by naked faith, I can only
expect it to be the same now. All our enemies have
to be conquered by <i>faith</i>, not realization;
and is it not so with the last enemy, death? Yes, if
it please the Lord that I should go down into the
dark valley without any realization, simply knowing
that I am His, and He is mine, I am quite willing&ndash;I
accept it.&#8217;</p>

<p>This is the faith that made our Army Mother and all
the Bible saints such conquerors. It is the secret
of their victory&ndash;the faith without which it is impossible
to please God, and for which we all need to pray, &#8217;Lord,
increase our faith.&#8217;</p>

<h1><a name="ch_11"></a>XI</h1>

<h2>Last Days</h2>

<p>&#8217;As I look back on life I do not remember the
houses I have lived in, the people that I have known,
the things of passing interest at the moment. They
are all gone. There is nothing stands out before my
mind as of any consequence, but the work I have done
for God and Eternity.&#8217;&mdash;<i>Mrs. Booth</i>.</p>

<p>If The General and those who loved our Army Mother
best had been able to choose for her, they would most
likely have said: &#8217;Let her live and fight and
work on, up to within a few days of her promotion to
Glory. Let the call come quickly and painlessly, as
it has come to others in our ranks.&#8217;</p>

<p>But the Lord, who loved her more than we did, saw
fit to send to her two and a half years of ever-increasing
weariness and suffering. For long months she lay on
the very bank of the River, longing for the messenger
of Death to carry her across. Those who loved her could
not tell why the Lord sent her this last fiery trial;
they could only bow with her, and say, &#8216;Thy
will be done.&#8217;</p>

<p>It was in February, 1888, that Mrs. Booth, who was
anxious about her health, went to consult a great
doctor and get his opinion. She was alone, for no
one had thought her illness was so serious. She asked
him to tell her the truth&ndash;all through her life, as
you know, she wanted the truth; and after a little
hesitation he told her.</p>

<p>The truth was the saddest that she could hear. That
dreadful illness&ndash;cancer&ndash;through which she had so
tenderly nursed her own dear mother, had come to her,
and in the doctor&#8217;s opinion she had much suffering
to pass through, and only two or, at the most, three
years longer to live. Mrs. Booth listened calmly,
thanked the doctor, and then, getting once more into
the cab, drove home all alone.</p>

<p>It was a dark journey. The War needed her. The General
needed her. Her children needed her. And yet the sentence
of Death had been passed upon her, and she must soon
leave them all. What did she do? I think you can guess.</p>

<p>She knelt down in the cab, and in prayer committed
to God, in a new and deeper way than ever before,
her own body, and her dear ones and the work He had
given her to do.</p>

<p>At last the cab stopped before her own door, and The
General came out to meet her.</p>

<p>&#8216;I shall never forget that meeting in this world,
or the next,&#8217; he says. &#8217;I had been watching
for the cab, and had run out to meet her and help
her up the steps. She tried to smile on me through
her tears; but, drawing me into the room, soon told
me, bit by bit, what the doctor had said. I sat down
speechless. She rose from her seat, and came and knelt
beside me, saying: &#8220;Do you know what was my first
thought? That I should not be there to nurse you in
your last hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8217;I was stunned. I felt as if the whole world
were coming to a standstill. Opposite me, on the wall,
was a picture of Christ on the cross. I thought I
could understand it then, as never before. She talked
to me like an angel; she talked as she had never talked
before. I could say little or nothing. I could only
kneel with her and try to pray. That very same night
The General was to leave London for some great Meetings
in Holland, and Mrs. Booth would not hear of his changing
his plans and remaining with her.</p>

<p>&#8216;The War must go on&#8217; was her thought,
even when all her family stood stunned and heart-broken
around her, unwilling to leave her even for a moment.</p>

<p>Two years later, when but a few more days of suffering
remained to her, a last message from her lips reached
us as Self-Denial Week began. &#8217;The War must
go on&#8217; was one of its sentences.</p>

<p>&#8216;The War must go on&#8217; had been as her motto,
lived out in all the long, long months that lay between.
Instead of immediately laying aside her work, when
the doctors gave their dreadful judgment, and beginning
to think only of herself, she went on with it as long
as her increasing weakness allowed.</p>

<p>But step by step the disease grew worse. First she
was forced to give up Meetings and public work. Then
it became impossible for her to use her right hand,
and she was therefore obliged to give up her correspondence,
though she still continued to dictate her letters,
and learnt also to write with her left hand.</p>

<p>Soon her daily drives became too tiring, and by and
by she went out of the house into the little garden
for the last time; and then for the concluding twelve
months of her life she was a prisoner in her room,
lying in constant suffering.</p>

<p>But during these long months the greatest joy and
relief that could come to her was to hear of some
fresh victory or triumph for the Kingdom of Jesus.
Her interest in The Army and her love for the people
were as keen as ever, and War Councils were held and
new developments planned in her chamber, and much
of The General&#8217;s Darkest England Scheme for the
poor and outcast was thought out and decided upon
beside her sick bed.</p>

<p>Again and again, too, Mrs. Booth would receive deputations
of Officers of different classes and from various
countries in which The Army was at work, who came
to Clacton-on-Sea, where the last fifteen months of
her life were spent, to listen to her words of advice
and inspiration.</p>

<p>There were no Corps Cadets in those days; but our
Army Mother left some specially beautiful words about
the Juniors, to which I must refer.</p>

<p>When she was told by the Officer then in charge of
our Junior Work in England that the children loved
and prayed continually for her, she smiled.</p>

<p>&#8216;The thought of the little ones,&#8217; says
some one who was there, &#8217;brought our beloved
Army Mother wholly out of herself and her pain and
weariness.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A very choice branch of the work,&#8217; she
said. &#8217;I have often told Emma that I hoped when
I was too old for public work God would let me end
where I began&ndash;with the children. But it seems that
it is not to be so.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Give the children,&#8217; she went on, in reply
to the messages they had sent, &#8217;my dear love,
and tell them that if there had been a Salvation Army
when I was ten I should have been a Soldier then,
as I am to-day.</p>

<p>Never allow yourself to be discouraged in your work.
I know you must meet with many discouragements; but
I am sure the Spirit of God works mightily on little
children long before grown people think they are able
to understand.&#8217;</p>

<p>Again and again during that last year of awful suffering
it seemed as if Mrs. Booth were about to leave us;
but then she would revive, and come back to endure
more weeks and months of agony.</p>

<p>But at last, on October 4, 1890, all could see that
she was on the brink of the River, and even those
who loved her the most tenderly could not wish to
hold her back.</p>

<p>&#8216;O Emma, let me go, darling,&#8217; she whispered;
and hearing the reply, &#8217;Yes, we will, we will,&#8217;
she said, &#8216;Now! Yes, Lord, come, Oh, come!&#8217;</p>

<p>The singing of The Army songs seemed to comfort her;
and once she raised her suffering arm, and pointed
to the text, &#8217;<i>My grace is sufficient for
thee</i>,&#8217; which hung on the wall. It was
lifted down and placed at the foot of her bed, so
that her eyes could often rest on it during those
last hours.</p>

<p>&#8216;Soon after noon,&#8217; says the present General,
&#8217;I felt that the deepening darkness of the Valley
was closing around my dear mother, and a little later
I took my last farewell. Her lips moved, and she gave
me one look of unspeakable tenderness and trust which
will live with me for ever. Again we sang:&ndash;</p>

<blockquote>My mistakes His free grace doth cover,<br />
&#160;&#160;My sins He doth wash away;<br />
These feet which shrink and falter<br />
&#160;&#160;Shall enter the Gates of Day.</blockquote>

<p>And, holding her hand, The General gave her up to
God. It was a solemn and wonderful scene.&#8217;</p>

<p>The Chief of the Staff and Mrs. Bramwell Booth, Mrs.
Booth-Tucker, and the Commander, and her three daughters,
Marian, Eva, and Lucy, knelt round the bed, upon which
were placed photographs of the other members of her
family who were unavoidably absent. Near to her stood
her faithful nurse, Captain Carr, and others of the
household, the dear General bowing over his beloved
wife and companion in life&#8217;s long strife, and
giving her up to the keeping of the Father.</p>

<p>One by one the members of the family tenderly embraced
her; then a gleam of recognition passed over the brightening
countenance as The General bent over her. Their eyes
met&ndash;-the last kiss of love on earth, the last word
till the Morning, and without a movement the breathing
gently ceased, and a warrior laid down her sword to
receive her crown.</p>

<hr width="75%" size="1" />

<p>You may have heard of those wonderful days from Tuesday
morning till Sunday night, when the coffin containing
the precious remains of our Army Mother lay at the
Congress Hall, Clapton, and when more than fifty thousand
people came to have a last look at her dear face.</p>

<p>A piece of glass had been let into the plain oak coffin.
It was just large enough to show the head and shoulders,
and she lay as if in a sweet sleep.</p>

<p>You wonder if many came merely from curiosity. Some
did, of course, but most of the people came because
her life and example and words had been so blessed
to their souls; and they came as they would come to
look at the dead face of their own mother. It was
the most wonderful tribute to a woman&#8217;s life
and words that London had ever seen.</p>

<p>For all kinds of people came&ndash;rich and poor, good
and bad, people of many different religions, and many
with no religion at all. Working men came in their
dinner-hour, with their tools on their backs and tears
in their eyes; mothers lifted up their little children
to look at the one who had taught them the way of
life; and, best of all, by the side of her coffin
knelt many a wanderer and backslider to give themselves
afresh to God.</p>

<p>More than one poor girl went direct from the Congress
Hall to the Rescue Homes, to begin to live &#8216;as
she would have wished&#8217;; and the Cadets on guard
were all the time dealing with drunkards and helping
those who desired to begin from thenceforth to live
a new and different life.</p>

<p>Even to-day, twenty-four years later, we often meet
those who date their conversion, or their first step
in the Narrow Way, from their look at that face lying
in its simple coffin.</p>

<p>One of Mrs. Booth&#8217;s own grandchildren, Mary,
the present General&#8217;s second daughter, looks
back to that scene as the time when God in an unmistakable
manner sealed her as His. She was only five years old
as she knelt by the coffin, but nevertheless she decided
there, in her childish consecration, like Ruth of
old, that &#8217;Thy people shall be my people, and
thy God my God&#8217;; and in the spirit of this consecration
she lives to-day.</p>

<hr width="75%" size="1" />

<p>In order that some of the crowds who wished to share
in the funeral service might be present, the largest
hall in London, the Olympia, was taken. Twenty-six
thousand people filled it; and though it was, of course,
impossible for them all to hear, they followed the
service given on printed papers with reverent sympathy.</p>

<p>The coffin was carried down the immense hall by Officers;
The General and his family followed.</p>

<p>Those who arranged for this last mighty gathering
remembered that Mrs. Booth, when with us, was never
happy to leave a Meeting unless it had been brought
to a point, and something definite had been done; and
therefore, when the songs and prayers and readings
were over, the huge crowd was asked to kneel and make
a solemn covenant with God.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful covenant, and ended with these
words:&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8217;And now, in this solemn hour, and in the presence
of death, I come again to Thy footstool, and make
this covenant with Thee.&#8217;</p>

<p>Then all who had made the covenant from their hearts
rose and sang together:&ndash;</p>

<blockquote>Just as I am Thou dost receive,<br />
Dost welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve,<br />
Because Thy promise I believe,<br />
O Lamb of God, I come!</blockquote>

<p>It was just such an ending to the wonderful service
as our Army Mother would have chosen had she been
still on earth with us.</p>

<hr width="75%" size="1" />

<p>The next morning was dry and bright. &#8217;I shall
ask God to give you a fine day for my funeral, Emma,
so that you mayn&#8217;t take cold,&#8217; our Army
Mother had said, for she was ever thoughtful for others;
and her prayer was answered, for though the white
mist crept up from the river to the Embankment, where
the procession was forming up, there was no rain nor
wind.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of our dear Soldiers would gladly
have sacrificed a day&#8217;s work in order to follow
in the funeral procession of one they so dearly loved;
but, so as not to gather too large a crowd, only Officers
were allowed in the march, which passed through countless
throngs of people from International Headquarters
to Abney Park Cemetery, a distance of about five miles.</p>

<p>All along the route the crowds stood in dense masses,
and roofs, windows, and every nook and corner were
packed with human beings. Nothing had been seen like
it, said the police, since the Duke of Wellington&#8217;s
funeral, forty years before.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful march. I wish you could have seen
it! Sometimes it seemed as if every one was weeping;
and when the open hearse, with its plain oak coffin,
crowned by The Army bonnet and well-worn Bible, passed,
all heads were bared, all voices hushed, and tears
filled all eyes.</p>

<p>The General, standing alone in his open carriage all
along the long, sad way, must have felt that he had
the people&#8217;s sympathy and love with him in his
grief, for scores of heartfelt &#8216;God bless you&#8217;s!&#8217;
came from lips that are unused to such words.</p>

<p>And at last the yellow evening sun shone out as the
great procession reached the gates of Abney Park Cemetery
and wound towards the open grave.</p>

<p>Only a part of the mighty throng could hear The General&#8217;s
beautiful words, so strong and yet so tender, from
which I have already quoted, but all joined in the
song, &#8216;Rock of Ages,&#8217; which seemed to roll
up to the heavens themselves.</p>

<p>Several leading Officers and members of The General&#8217;s
own family prayed and spoke, wonderfully upheld in
spite of their deep grief and the strain of the last
days. And then by the open grave the present General
led all hearts to make a fresh consecration, the whole
assembly promising, with God&#8217;s help, that they
would be</p>

<p>&#8217;Faithful to Thee, faithful to one another,
and faithful to a dying world, till we meet our beloved
Mother in the Morning. Amen.&#8217;</p>

<hr width="75%" size="1" />

<p>If ever you are in Abney Park Cemetery you should
visit her grave. It is very simple. Around the little
piece of earth runs a grey stone, with these words
carved on it:&ndash;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-varian: small-caps">Catherine Booth,</p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-varian: small-caps">Mother of The Salvation Army</p>

<p style="text-align: center">More than Conqueror, through Him that loved us,<br />
and gave Himself for all the world and for you.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Do you also follow Christ?</p>

<p>and above are two small beds of flowers.</p>

<p>Do many people go to see it? you wonder.</p>

<p>Oh, yes. All round it a path is worn in the grass,
made by the tread of many feet; for mothers bring
their boys and girls to see it, and tell them what
a mother she was, and men and women of all creeds and
races pause beside it, and remember.</p>

<p>Many Officers, too&ndash;from distant lands, and speaking
strange tongues you could not understand&ndash;come to
The Army Mother&#8217;s grave when they visit our
shores. For she was their Mother as well as ours, they
say.</p>

<p>They kneel beside the stone, and spell out the name,
and then they consecrate themselves afresh to God
and the needs of the heathen lands, and they claim
His grace to follow in her steps.</p>

<p>For our Army Mother is not dead. True, her body lies
in the quiet grave at Abney Park, and her spirit is
in Heaven; but her life and influence still live among
us, her words are treasured, and our greatest prayer
and desire for the girls and wives and mothers in
our ranks is that they may live to be worthy daughters
of Catherine Booth.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
